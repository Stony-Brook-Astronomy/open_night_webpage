    <h1>The Dark Energy Survey: understanding our Universe through gravitational lensing</h1>
    <h2>Dr. Tae-Hyeon Shin</h2>

  <p>
In the presence of gravity, the light paths become deflected, which we call "gravitational lensing": the stronger the gravity is, the more deflected the light paths are.
Consequently, the light from the background galaxies of the Universe is distorted by the foreground mass structure.
Therefore, one can statistically analyze this distortion of background light of galaxies in the sky to infer the large-scale structure of the universe and its evolution in cosmic time.

In this talk, the recent developments to precisely measure the gravitational lensing with a large galaxy survey, such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and how specifically the gravitational lensing can constrain the evolution of cosmic structure will be discussed.
In addition, I will discuss the prospects of gravitational lensing with the future galaxy surveys, such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), which would be accompanied by orders of magnitude higher statistical power.



  <p>Dr. Tae-hyeon Shin received his Ph.D. from University of Pennsylvania in
    2020. 
He has been a postdoctoral researcher at Stony Brook University since Sep 2021. 
    His works focus on the structure and the evolution of clusters of galaxies
    using gravitational lensing and cross-correlation, and thereby
    constraining cosmological parameters.
