                  <h1> Evidence for Dark Matter.</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
For decades astronomers and astrophysicists
have been aware that not all of the matter in the universe
is visible.     However, just because we can't see this
matter directly ,  the gravitational influence of this unseen
"stuff" can still be observed indirectly.    We now call this
"stuff" dark matter.    Furthermore, we now know that
ark matter is different from ordinary matter and that there
is more dark matter in the universe than ordinary matter.
In this talk we will discuss have we have arrived at this 
astonishing conclusion and what we know about dark 
matter. 

<p>
Prof. Swesty has been associated with astronomy at Stony Brook for
twenty one years, initially as a graduate student and then, after 5 years
at the University of Illinois, returning as a faculty member.  He
has studied core collapse supernovae, neutron stars, the behavior
of neutron stars  in close binary systems, and the properties
of neutron star material.
