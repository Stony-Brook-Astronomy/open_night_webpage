</CENTER>

<p>
Aside from hydrogen and helium and a few other light elements and
isotopes, the elements in our bodies and on earth trace their origins to
stars.  During their lifetimes, stars produce energy by fusing light
elements into heavier elements.  At the final stage of stellar evolution,
supernova explosions synthesize the heaviest elements.  Binary systems,
through nova or X-ray burst explosions also contribute to elemental
production.  In this talk, I will present an overview of the process of
stellar nucleosynthesis and outline some of the sites where it takes place
in our galaxy.

<p>
Prof. Zingale is an Assistant Professor of Astronomy in Stony Brook's
department of Physics and Astronomy.  This is his fourth year at
Stony Brook, coming most recently from a postdoctoral position at the
University of California at Santa Cruz. His research is in modeling
stellar explosions and the basic physics therein.
