    <h1>Neutron Star or Black Hole?</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Doug Swesty</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>On August 14 of 2019 the Laser Interferometric Gravitational      
Observatory, LIGO, observed the merger of two massive objects by
detecting the gravitational waves emitted as the orbit of these
objects decayed until they collided.  Yet the most thrilling aspect of
this event, known as GW190814, is that the observations of event
determined that mass of one of these objects was 2.6 solar masses
making it either the heaviest known neutron star or the lightest known
black hole.  Either of these possibilities is very exciting to astrophysicists
and in this talk we will discuss the implications of both possibilities.


<p>Prof. Swesty received his PhD in Physics from SUNY Stony Brook in 1993. 
He spent six years at the University of Illinois as a postdoctoral researcher 
and as a Visiting Assistant Professor.   He returned to Stony Brook in 1999 
where he is currently a Research Associate Professor.  His work focuses on 
nuclear astrophysics and computational astrophysics.
