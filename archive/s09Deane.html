<p> Our understanding of how the Sun's planetary system formed and evolved
has dramatically matured, particularly since the era of the Apollo
moon walks.  While many of the main characteristics of the system now
make sense there are still a lot of curious discoveries that haven't
somehow fit in. Recent computer models of how the planets adjusted
their positions in the first billion years after forming have lead to
some startling conclusions: the system of 8 planets was initially very
compact - a third the size it is now - and Neptune was located between
Saturn and Uranus.

<p> In the next in the popular lecture series, Astronomy Open Nights,
Prof. Deane Peterson will describe the reasons for this rather startling
claim and the array of details it helps explain.  There is a growing
consensus that the planetary system so familiar to us, looks vastly
different now that when it formed.

<p> Dr. Peterson, a resident of Poquott, NY, studies stars, their
composition, and how stars evolve.  He has been a member of the Stony
Brook faculty since 1970, and has taught the introductory course on the
Solar System more often than any person alive.
