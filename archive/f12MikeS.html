                  <h1>Tides in the Solar System</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
Living on an island most of us are well familiar with the tides and
their rhythms and appreciate our Moon's role in producing the tides.
Less appreciated is the effect of tidal torques and friction in slowing
the Earth's rotation while the Moon's orbit expands.  Elsewhere in
the Solar System tidal forces on planetary satellites produce internal
heating which in extreme cases gives rise to volcanoes.  In this Open
Night talk Dr. Simon will discuss how tidal forces arise and how they
affect the structure and orbits of bodies throughout the Solar System.

Dr. Michal Simon is Professor Ermitus and active Research Professor
in Stony Brook's Department of Physics and Astronomy.  He aims to improve
our understanding of young stars and their formation as binaries. His
approaches include measurements of stellar mass, binary frequency, and the
properties of circumstellar disks. This research uses state-of-the-art
instrumentation in several areas of astronomy. Since the research is
often collaborative, it offers graduate students the opportunity not only
the opportunity to observe with instruments at the forefront of modern
astronomy, but also to work with individuals who are expert in their
use. Specific recent results may be found in the NASA ADS listings
and on astro-ph. In retirement, his professional life has changed
little except that he avoid faculty meetings and does not have formal
teaching assignments. He enjoys working with students. Dr. Simonâ€™s
current teaching activity includes supervision of graduate students
and undergraduate research projects and, occasionally, an advanced
topics seminar.
