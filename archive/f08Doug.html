</CENTER>
<p>In 1934 astonomers Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky
postulated that a "Super Nova" explosion was caused
by the collapse of the core of a massive star.   For over
five decades this was purely a theoretial speculation
that was not confirmed experimentally until 1987 by
the observations of neutrinos from supernova 1987A.
Despite the fact that we now know what causes such
superovae we still don't understand the "how":  how the
collapsing coe results in an tremendous explosion of a
massive star.   In this talk I will explain what we currently
do, and do not, know about supernovae.

<p>Prof. Swesty has been associated with astronomy at Stony Brook for
twenty years, initially as a graduate student and then, after 5 years
at the University of Illinois, returning as a faculty member.  He
has studied core collapse supernovae, neutron stars, the behavior
of neutron stars  in close binary systems, and the properties
of neutron star material.
