    <h1>Unveiling the First Moments of the Universeâ€™s Creation with the Simons Observatory</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Neelima Sehgal</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>I will discuss how we are collecting the oldest light in the Universe,
called the Cosmic Microwave Background, in order to determine what happened
in the first fraction of a second after the Big Bang.  We collect this light
with microwave telescopes in the Atacama Desert in Chile.  I will discuss a
new $40 million project to build the next generation of microwave telescopes
in Chile, which will be called the Simons Observatory.  This new observatory
has the potential to detect ancient gravitational waves that could unlock the
mysteries of how galaxies and stars (and we) came to be.  The detection of
this signal would also unlock the mysteries of how gravity works by providing
direct evidence that gravity and quantum mechanics are joined at the highest
energies.  I will also explain how work at Stony Brook plays a critical role
in this research.   


<p>Neelima Sehgal is a Cosmologist in the Physics and Astronomy Department at
Stony Brook.  She studies the Cosmic Microwave Background, which is the oldest
light in the Universe, to determine what happened during the first few
fractions of a second after the Big Bang.  She also studies the Cosmic
Microwave Background to discover the properties of neutrinos, dark matter, and
dark energy.  Neelima is a member of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the
Simons Observatory Collaborations.   She received her B.S. in Physics and
Mathematics from Yale University and her PhD in Physics and Astronomy from
Rutgers University.   She was a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford and Princeton
Universities before joining the faculty at Stony Brook in 2012.
