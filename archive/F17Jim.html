    <h1>When Neutron Stars Collide:  The Story of GW170817</hl>
    <h2>Prof. Jim Lattimer</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>The recent LIGO/VIRGO observation of gravitational waves from the
merger of two neutron stars, and follow-up observations in gamma ray,
X-rays, ultraviolet, optical, infrared, millimeter and radio radiation
was the most intensively studied astronomical event of all time.
These observations revealed that two approximately 1.4 solar mass
neutron stars merged after being born in supernova explosions and
orbiting each other for around 11 billion years, and in the process,
created a short gamma-ray burst and ejected about 20,000 Earth masses
of heavy elements into space.  The merger occurred in a galaxy far,
far, away, about 130 million light years distant.  It seems likely
that the remnant collapsed into a black hole within a second.  The
optical and infrared radiation observed for over a week following the
merger likely originates from the radioactive decay of nuclei formed
from ejected neutron star matter, which apparently solves the
century-old mystery of the origin of half of elements heavier than
iron, the so-called r-process elements, which include gold and
platinum.  This event also confirmed the association between short
gamma-ray bursts and mergers.

<p>
Jim Lattimer has been on the astronomy faculty at Stony Brook
University for nearly 40 years, mostly studying supernovae, neutron
stars, and the dense matter equation of state.  He and his thesis
advisor, David Schramm, first predicted 43 years ago that
merger-ejected neutron star matter would synthesize r-process
elements.  But until recently, this idea was met with skepticism and
it was widely believed that supernovae were responsible for the
creation of these elements.  This talk will not only discuss the
observations of GW170817, but will also present a first-hand history
of the debate concerning the origin of r-process elements.
