    <h1>The SMARTS way to observe: What recent observations tell us about galactic novae</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Frederick Walter</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>In 2003 NOAO, the US national observatory divested 
itself of their small (i.e., meter-class) telescopes. 
The SMARTS consortium has operated these telescopes at Cerro
Tololo Interamerican Observatory since then.
Unlike the classical observing mode of a few full nights at the telescope
at infrequent intervals, 
SMARTS queue-scheduled observations afford the opportunity to obtain frequent
observations of interesting targets. 

<p>Over the past 15 years I have invested a great deal of effort in observing
and studying the galactic novae, which are thermonuclear runaways
(hydrogen bombs) on the surfaces of
white dwarf stars accreting gas from close companion stars. Novae are
interesting not only because they explode, but because they are a common
end state of low mass stars, because they form dust, and because they
may be the source of the bulk of the Lithium found in the Galaxy.

<p>Following introductions to SMARTS and to the novae, I shall 
use examples of recent bright novae to illustrate how
high-cadence observations have changed our view of the nova explosions.
This is publically-accessible science: I shall highlight how contributions
made by amateur astronomers contribute to the field.

<p>Prof. Walter, a resident of East Setauket,
studies star birth, stellar weather (including stellar coronae),
and star death using
the <em>Chandra</em> and XMM-<em>Newton</em> X-ray observatories,
the Hubble Space Telescope,
and telescopes in Arizona, Hawaii and Chile.
He has been a professor of Astronomy at Stony Brook since 1989.
