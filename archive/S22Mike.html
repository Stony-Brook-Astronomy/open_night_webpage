    <h1>Making the Elements</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Michael Zingale</h2>

  </CENTER>

  <p>
We can trace the calcium in our bones and iron in our blood back to stars -- in their quest for more and more energy, they fuse heavier and heavier elements, building up all of the elements after hydrogen and helium on the periodic table.  At the final stage of stellar evolution, supernova explosions and stellar mergers make the very heaviest elements. In this talk, I will present an overview of the process of stellar nucleosynthesis and outline some of the sites where it takes place.

    

  <p>Prof. Zingale is a Professor of Astronomy in Stony Brook's department of Physics & Astronomy. He
joined the Department in 2006, coming most recently from a postdoctoral position at the University of California
at Santa Cruz. His research is in modeling stellar explosions and the basic physics therein, and developing
algorithms for performing supercomputer simulations of astrophysical fluid flow.
