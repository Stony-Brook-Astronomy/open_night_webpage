Extrasolar planets are now part of the daily scientific news stream.  Nearly 1000 are known, and as many as 10,000 more will be known in just 10 years.  Why do we care to find more?  Because among the hundreds of Jupiter and Neptune analogs that are turning up around nearby stars, a few of the new discoveries are starting to look strikingly similar to our own Earth: a one Earth-mass planet in the habitable zone around its host star.  In this talk I will present how close we are to finding an Earth twin, and will foreshadow the exciting discoveries for the decade ahead.

Prof. Metchev came to Stony Brook as an assistant professor in 2008. His research focuses on extrasolar planets, brown dwarfs, and nearby young stars. He lives with his family in Huntington, where he patiently observes as his children grow.
