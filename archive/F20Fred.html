    <h1>The Sun in Time: Solar Irradiance and Climate Change</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Frederick Walter</h2>

  </CENTER>

  <p>The temperature of the Earth is set by an equilibrium between the
    Solar energy absorbed and the heat radiated away by the Earth. For the
    past 4.4 billion years this precarious equilibrium has held even as the
    Solar irradiance has increased by about 30%. Today, as the Earth is
    noticeably growing warmer, some claim that an increase in Solar
    irradiance is to blame for global warming, while others point to a
    decrease in Solar magnetic activity as presaging a coming
    "Maunder minimum" and a global cooling.

  <p>I shall review the evidence that the temperature of the Earth has
    remained stable for the past 4.4 billion years. I shall discuss what
    we know of solar and stellar variability, and discuss how stable
    temperatures have been maintained even as the Sun has brighted.
    The evidence shows that none of the
    rapid change in global temperature over the past century can be
    attributed to the Sun. Furthermore, I shall argue that even a prolonged
    activity minimum is unlikely to start an episode of global cooling.

  <p>We have only ourselves to blame for bringing on climate change and
    global warming and all their associated ills.
    

<p>Prof. Walter, a resident of East Setauket,
studies star birth, stellar weather, and star death using
the <em>Chandra</em> and XMM-<em>Newton</em> X-ray observatories,
the Hubble Space Telescope,
and telescopes in Arizona, Hawaii and Chile.
He has been a professor of Astronomy at Stony Brook since 1989.
