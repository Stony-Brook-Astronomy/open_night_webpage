    <h1>What did New Horizons teach us about the system formerly 
        known as Planet Pluto?</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Alan Calder</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>
On July 14, 2015 NASA's New Horizons probe, launched in 2006, flew by
dwarf planet Pluto giving us our first detailed observations of Pluto
and its moons. I will give an overview of our solar system and its
formation to set the context of this mission. While the process of
receiving data from New Horizons will continue for months, we have
received high-resolution images of the surface and atmosphere that
indicate and unexpected amount of activity. I will present early
results and what we have learned, and also new questions that have
arisen.

<p>Prof. Calder joined the Stony Brook Physics and Astronomy
department in 2007 after research appointments at the University of
Illinois and the University of Chicago. His research is in
computational astrophysics and he has studied a variety of problems
including core collapse and thermonuclear supernovae, coalescing
neutron stars, and classical novae.
