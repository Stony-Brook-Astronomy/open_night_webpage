                  <h1>Evidence for the Big Bang</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
In this lecture I will present the evidence that has lead
 astrophysicists to the conclusion that the known Universe 
 began as a violent explosion that we refer to as the
 Big Bang.    There are now multiple pieces  of information that 
 point to the Universe as having ang age of 13-14 billion years.  
I will discuss how we obtained this evidence and were lead 
to this conclusion starting from a historical perspective.

<p>
Prof. Swesty has been associated with astronomy at Stony Brook for
twenty one years, initially as a graduate student and then, after 5 years
at the University of Illinois, returning as a faculty member.  He
has studied core collapse supernovae, neutron stars, the behavior
of neutron stars  in close binary systems, and the properties
of neutron star material.
