<h1> Dwarf Satellites: The search for the Universe's smallest galaxies </h1>

</CENTER>



<p>Anywhere from one-tenth to one-millionth the size of our Milky Way,
dwarf galaxies are the smallest and faintest in the Universe.  Seen to
swarm around giant galaxies, they are also the most numerous. Their
existence and relative numbers provide some of the most important
constraints we have on the details of how galaxies form but unfortunately
they are the most elusive to find and study.  The dwarf satellite
population in the vicinity of our galaxy, the Milky Way, and our neighbor,
Andromeda, provide the best studied sample of these tiny galaxies and
yet the numbers still do not match theoretical predictions.  Does this
spell doom for the standard cold dark matter model?  Or, could we live
amongst a swarm of truly invisible galaxies?

<p>In the next of the popular series Astronomy Open Night, Dr. Kathleen
Flint Ehm will discuss the search for dwarf galaxies in the nearby
Universe.  She will highlight the recent explosion of discoveries within
our own Local Group of galaxies and examine the implications for how
such small but dark matter-rich objects might form.

<p>Dr. Flint is project manager for the National Postdoctoral Association
in Washington, DC, and an adjunct professor in Physics and Astronomy
at Stony Brook.  She received her Ph.D. in astronomy and astrophysics
from UC Santa Cruz and was a Carnegie Fellow at the Carnegie Institution
of Washington.  Dr. Flint came to Stony Brook in 2005 from the National
Science Foundation where she was an AAAS Science and Technology Policy
Fellow.  She lives in Port Jefferson Station.
