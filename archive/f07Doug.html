                       <h1>Merging White Dwarf Stars</h1>

</CENTER>
<p>White dwarf stars are the end of the evolutionary line for normal stars
of about one solar mass.  Many times such stars are formed in binary
systems where one star is in orbit around another.  But what happens
when the orbits of these stars decay and the two stars violently merge?
Does a supernova occur?  Is an extreme star formed?

<p>In the next of the popular series Astronomy Open Night, Prof. Swesty
will discuss how binary white dwarf systems are formed, why their
orbits decay, and what happens when they merge.

<p>Prof. Swesty has been associated with astronomy at Stony Brook for
nineteen years, initially as a graduate student and then, after 5 years
at the University of Illinois, returning as a faculty member.  His
research is on Neutron stars, how they form and how they behave in
close binary systems.  He lives with his family in E. Setauket.
