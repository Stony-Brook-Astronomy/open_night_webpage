    <h1>Where Do Elements Heavier Than Iron Come From?</h1>
    <h2>Prof. James Lattimer</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>The three lightest elements in the universe, hydrogen, helium and
lithium, originally formed in the Big Bang.  The next two, beryllium
and boron, are primarily produced by cosmic ray interactions with the
interstellar medium.  The bulk of the next two dozen heavier elements
come from ordinary stars and supernovae.  But where do heavier
elements, such as gold, platinum and lead, come from?  Most of the
heavier elements had to be synthesized in neutron capture processes,
either slowly (the s-process) or rapidly (the r-process); each is
responsible for about half of all isotopes heavier than iron.  The
source of s-process elements, such as copper, zinc, tin and lead, are
thought to be stellar winds from evolving low- to medium-mass stars
(up to about 8 solar masses).  The source of the r-process elements,
such as gold, platinum and uranium, is controversial.  Since the
1950s, the prevailing theory has been supernovae.  However, the
r-process requires ejected matter that is more neutron-rich than
computations indicate.  In the mid-1970s, my advisor and I proposed a
speculative alternative theory, that they are produced in matter
ejected from neutron stars merging with neutron stars or black holes.
In the last five years, evidence has been accumulating in favor of the
neutron star theory.  The evidence comes from observations ranging
from spectra of the most metal-poor stars, studies of ultra-faint
dwarf galaxies, and afterglows from short gamma-ray bursts (which may
be mergers).  Theoretical support stems from numerical simulations of
both mergers and cosmological studies of galaxy formation.  In the
near future, mergers involving neutron stars might even be observed by
gravitational wave observatories, which could vindicate or refute this
theory.

<p>Prof. Lattimer is a Distinguished Professor in the Dept. of Physics &
Astronomy at Stony Brook.  His interests lie mostly in nuclear
astrophysics, especially with theories of dense matter and neutron
stars.
