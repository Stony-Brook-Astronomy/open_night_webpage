    <h1>Man-made Space Weather:  A Catastrophe for Modern Civilization?</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Doug Swesty</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>In the 20<sup>th</sup> century humankind began to influence the magnetic field in
space surrounding the Earth.   Sources of this influence include high altitude
chemical releases, high-frequency ionospheric heating experiments, and
nuclear tests.
The results of this influence have, at times, been unexpected.   
This talk will discuss these influences and the consequences of this man-made
space weather.  In at least one case man-made space weather poses a
catastrophic threat to modern civilization.



<p>Prof. Swesty received his PhD in Physics from SUNY Stony Brook in 1993. 
He spent six years at the University of Illinois as a postdoctoral researcher 
and as a Visiting Assistant Professor.   He returned to Stony Brook in 1999 
where he is currently a Research Associate Professor.  His work focuses on 
nuclear astrophysics and computational astrophysics.
