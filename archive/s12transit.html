                  <h1>Transit of Venus</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
The Stony Brook Astronomy group will have a special Open Night
for the transit of Venus on the evening of June 5.

<p>
The start of the event is 5:30 PM with transit beginning at 6:03 PM.
If it is clear, we will have two telescopes set up to observe the
transit in the area between the Math and Physics buildings and the
Simons Center. If it is cloudy, we will have a public lecture on
the transit of Venus in the Simons Center auditorium.

<p>
The Simons Center and Math and Physics buildings are next to the
ESS building, our usual venue.

<p>
Also, for those interested, there is simultaneous Celestial Wine and
Cheese event at the <A HREF="http://scgp.stonybrook.edu"> Simon's 
Center Cafe </A> from 5:30-9:00 PM ($55).
