<h1> Computing the Stars: How Computers Are Used in Astrophysics </h1>

</CENTER>



<p> Astronomy is an observational science -- we have to take what the
Universe gives us.  We cannot simply point at a star and ask it to
explode, but rather we must patiently observe large numbers of stars
and galaxies, in hopes of seeing a supernova.  This is in contrast to
experimental physics, where we create an experiment and are able to
manipulate the setup and observe the physical outcome.  One way to
overcome these limitations is to use the techniques of computational
science to model astrophysical phenomena, and allow for virtual
experimentation.  In this talk, I will discuss how computers are used
in astrophysics, what we might hope to learn, and what the limitations
are.


<p>In the next of the popular series Astronomy Open Night, Professor
Michael Zingale will discuss the use of computers and simulation
in astrophysics. He will highlight his talk with example simulations
of exploding stars, supernovae and X-ray bursts, from his own
research.

<p> Prof. Zingale is an Assistant Professor of Astronomy in Stony Brook's
department of Physics and Astronomy.  This is his third year at
Stony Brook, coming most recently from a postdoctoral position at the
University of California at Santa Cruz. His research is in modeling
stellar explosions and the basic physics therein.
