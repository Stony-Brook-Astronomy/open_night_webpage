    <h1>Detecting Gravitational Waves from the Infant Universe</h1>
    <h2>Neelima Sehgal</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>In this talk I will describe research efforts to understand our
infant Universe.  These efforts consist of measuring the fluctuations
in the cosmic microwave background which surrounds us to detect the
faint traces of gravitational waves from the first fractions of a
second after the Big Bang.  I will briefly review the recent detection
of gravitational waves from colliding black holes by the LIGO
instrument, and put early Universe gravitational waves in context.  I
will then discuss how scientists plan to detect these primordial
gravitational waves and why detecting them would have profound
implications for understanding the birth of our Universe and
fundamental physics.

<p>Prof. Neelima Sehgal has been an Assistant Professor in the Physics
and Astronomy Department at Stony Brook University since 2012. Her
research interests include understanding dark energy, dark matter,
neutrino properties, and the early Universe.
