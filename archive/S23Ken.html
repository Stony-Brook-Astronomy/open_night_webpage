    <h1>First Science Results from the Condor Array Telescope</hl>
    <h2>Prof. Kenneth Lanzetta</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>	
The Condor Array Telescope is an “array telescope” that is made up of six off-the-shelf refracting telescopes coupled with six off-the-shelf large-format CMOS camera all mounted onto a common mount.  The telescope was deployed to a very dark site near Animas, New Mexico in the spring of 2021 and was commissioned and calibrated over the course of the summer and autumn of 2021.  The telescope has been routine operation ever since, autonomously collecting observations every clear night.  In this lecture, Prof. Lanzetta will report the current status of the telescope and the project and will describe some of the observations that Condor has obtained over its first 18 months of operation.

Kenneth M. Lanzetta is a professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy of Stony Brook University.  He obtained a BA in physics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1983 and a PhD in physics from the University of Pittsburgh in 1988.  From there he spent two years as a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Astronomy of the University of Cambridge in England and then four  years as a postdoctoral researcher and Hubble Fellow at the Center for Astrophysics and Space Sciences of the University of California, San Diego before taking a position as assistant professor at Stony Brook University in 1994.  He was promoted to associate professor in 1997 and to professor in 2001.  His research interests involve extragalactic astronomy and cosmology, including issues of galaxy formation and evolution, quasar absorption lines, evolution of the intergalactic medium, detection and identification of faint, high-redshift galaxies, and development and application of optimal image processing techniques utilizing large-scale scientific computing facilities.
