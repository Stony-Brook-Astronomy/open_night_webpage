                  <h1>Exploring Jupiter with Juno</h1> 

</CENTER>

<p> 
NASA recently launched Juno, an orbiter due to reach Jupiter
in July, 2016. The stated goal of "Unlocking Jupiter's Mysteries"
includes measuring properties of Jupiter's atmosphere, probing
Jupiter's structure via measurements of its gravitational and
magnetic fields, and testing and validating planet formation
theories.

<p> 
In the next of the popular series Astronomy Open Night, Prof. Alan
Calder will discuss the Juno mission. He will describe the
gas giant planets, present theories of planetary formation, and
discuss the questions the Juno mission hopes to answer.

<p> 
Alan Calder joined the Stony Brook Physics and Astronomy department
in 2007 after research appointments at the University of Illinois
and the University of Chicago. His research is in numerically modeling
astrophysical phenomena, and he has studied core collapse and
thermonuclear supernovae, coalescing white dwarfs, and classical
novae.
