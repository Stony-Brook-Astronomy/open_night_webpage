                  <h1>Finding Planets Around Bright Stars</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>Planets a million or more times fainter than their parent stars are hard to see
against the glare of these stars.  We have developed effective ways of detecting
their presence and even measuring some of their properties.  For the first time ever,
astronomers recently imaged Jupiter-sized planets orbiting nearby stars.
Prof. Sivaramakrishnan will explain how we detect faint objects near bright stars,
using a variety of techniques: planetary transits, gravitiational lensing,
adaptive optics, and newly-developed interferometric methods planned for
NASA's flagship mission, the James Webb Space Telescope, due to launch mid-decade.

<p>Prof. Sivaramakrishnan has been an adjunct professor at Stony Brook since he moved
to New York in 2005.  He has built instruments for Palomar and other observatories,
and has worked on Hubble instruments and the planned James Webb Space Telescope.
He is engaged in enabling the direct imaging of planets, protoplanets, disks, and brown
dwarfs outside our Solar System.  Prof. Sivaramakrishnan lives with his family in
Huntington.
