                  <h1>Are you there E.T.? It's us, Earth: An Update on the Search for Life in the Universe</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>Mankind has long speculated about the existence and nature of
life elsewhere in the Universe. While there is no accepted evidence
of life anywhere other than Earth, contemporary studies 
apply the scientific method to answer these questions. 
The study of life in the Universe encompasses many traditional disciplines 
including Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, and Geology, and has been dubbed 
the field of "Astrobiology."

<p>In the next of the popular series Astronomy Open Night, Prof. Alan
Calder will discuss the scientific search for life in the Universe.
He will describe how our understanding of life on Earth guides the 
search for life elsewhere and some of the tools utilized in
the search. 

<p>Prof. Calder joined the Stony Brook Physics and Astronomy department
in 2007 after research appointments at the University of Illinois
and the University of Chicago. His research is in numerically modeling
astrophysical phenomena, and he has studied core collapse and
thermonuclear supernovae, coalescing white dwarfs, and classical
novae.
