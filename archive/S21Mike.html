    <h1>When Asteroids Attack</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Michael Zingale</h2>

  </CENTER>

  <p>Over Almost a decade ago, a meteor blast over Russia caused a lot of
    damage and even some injuries. Where did
    it come from? And what dangers lie ahead? In this talk we will talk about
    the origin of asteroids and comets---
    the leftover debris from the formation of the solar system, and what they tell
    us about the solar system. We'll
    explore the history of impacts on the planets (including earth) and discuss
    the dangers of, and potential
    solutions to, a future terrestrial impact.
    

  <p>Prof. Zingale is an Associate Professor of Astronomy in Stony Brook's department of Physics and Astronomy. He
joined the Department in 2006, coming most recently from a postdoctoral position at the University of California
at Santa Cruz. His research is in modeling stellar explosions and the basic physics therein, and developing
algorithms for performing supercomputer simulations of astrophysical fluid flow.
