    <h1>Habitable Planets: Hype or Hope?</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Fred Walter</h2>

  </CENTER>


  <p>Since the report of the first exoplanet in 1995, astronomers have
  used various techniques to discover over 1700 exoplanets, with
  another 4200 candidates, orbiting a wide variety of stars, mostly
  less massive and cooler than our Sun.  Some of these planets are
  touted as being potentially habitable.  This appellation relies
  solely on the luminosity of the star, and the distance of the planet
  from its star.  By this criterion alone, Earth is not a habitable
  planet.

  <p>I will discuss the definition of the habitable zone for life as
  we know it.  With the assumption that life requires billions of
  years of stable conditions to become complex, as it has on Earth, I
  will compare conditions on Earth over its history to those on
  planets of other stars.  The conclusion is that conditions on most
  other planets seem to be far less conducive to the development of
  complex life than they weer on Earth.

  <p>Prof. Walter is starting is 26th year at Stony Brook University,
  and has earned the right to be opinionated and curmudgeonly. He
  researches the birth, lives, and death of stars like the Sun, and
  also exploding white dwarfs.  He lives in East Setauket.
