    <h1>The Interstellar Visitor 'Oumuamua</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Philip Armitage</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>In Fall 2017 the Pan-STARRS telescope detected the first object of clearly 
interstellar origin passing fleetingly through the inner Solar System. Named 
'Oumuamua, after the Hawaiian word for "scout", our first interstellar visitor 
was a small body that may have originated as an asteroid or comet within an 
extrasolar planetary system. The existence of interstellar asteroids and 
comets was no surprise - our Solar System probably ejected many Earth 
masses of such bodies as it formed - but 'Oumuamua showed unexpected and 
mysterious properties that remain to be fully explained. In this talk I 
will discuss what we know about 'Oumuamua, and what we hope to learn 
about planet formation from future observations of similar visitors. 

<p>Prof. Phil Armitage is a theoretical astrophysicist in the Stony Brook
Physics & Astronomy Department. He is interested in the formation of planetary 
systems and the astrophysics of black holes. He joined Stony Brook 
last year after many years at the University of Colorado in Boulder.
