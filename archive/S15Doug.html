    <h1>What we know (and don't know) about core-collapse supernovae</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Doug Swesty</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>The final stages of the life of a massive star occur in a violent
explosion that astrophysicists refer to as a core-collapse supernovae.
Unfortunately, there is still much we don't know about these
explosions.  For over half a century scientists have been attempting
to use models to understand what causes the explosion.  And it's been
over a quarter of a century since we've been fortunate enough to get a
glimpse of what goes on in the interior of a core-collapse supernovae.
In this talk I will explain what we now know, as well as what we don't
know, about these incredible events.
