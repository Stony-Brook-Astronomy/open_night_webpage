    <h1>Stellar Nucleosynthesis and the Origin of the Elements</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Michael Zingale</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>Aside from hydrogen and helium and a few other light elements and isotopes,
the elements in our bodies and on earth trace their origins to stars.
During their lifetimes, stars produce energy by fusing light elements into
heavier elements. At the final stage of stellar evolution,
supernova explosions and stellar  mergers make the very heaviest elements.
In this talk, I will present an overview of the process of stellar
nucleosynthesis and outline some of the sites where it takes place.

<p>Prof. Zingale is an Associate Professor of Astronomy in Stony
  Brook's department of Physics and Astronomy.   He joined the Department
  in 2006, coming most recently from a postdoctoral position at
  the University of California at Santa Cruz. His research is in
  modeling stellar explosions and the basic physics therein, and he is
  an expert in numerical hydrodynamics.
