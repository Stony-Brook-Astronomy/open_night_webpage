                  <h1>Motion in the Skies</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
Even without a telescope, we can learn a lot about our place in the 
Universe by looking at the motions of the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars. 
In this talk we will discuss some of the significance of some of these 
early basic astronomical observations. Next time you look up at the 
skies, you will have a better understanding of the motions you see.


<p>
Prof. Zingale is an Associate Professor of Astronomy in Stony Brook's 
department of Physics and Astronomy. This is his seventh year at Stony 
Brook, coming most recently from a postdoctoral position at the University 
of California at Santa Cruz. His research is in modeling stellar explosions 
and the basic physics therein, and he is an expert in numerical 
hydrodynamics.
