    <h1>On Being (Un)Certain About Supernova Explosions</hl>
    <h2>Prof. Alan Calder</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>Thermonuclear (type Ia) supernovae are bright stellar explosions
with the unique property that the light curves may be standardized
and used as distance indicators for cosmological studies. Such use as
"standard candles" is widely accepted, but many questions remain about
the progenitor systems and the explosion mechanism.

In this talk, Prof. Alan Calder will present highlights from his research
into modeling type Ia supernova explosions. He will describe proposed
progenitor systems, proposed explosion mechanisms, and the physics
involved in these events. He will present recent results addressing the
question of how to quantify uncertainty in the progenitor stars.

<p>
Alan Calder joined the Stony Brook Physics and Astronomy department
in 2007 after research appointments at the University of Illinois and
the University of Chicago. His research is in numerically modeling
astrophysical phenomena, and he has studied a variety of problems
including core collapse and thermonuclear supernovae, merging neutron
stars, and classical novae.
