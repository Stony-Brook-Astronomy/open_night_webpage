    <h1>Searching for Life in the Universe</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Alan Calder</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>Mankind has long speculated about the existence and nature of life elsewhere in the Universe. While there is no accepted evidence of life anywhere other than Earth, contemporary studies apply the scientific method to answer these questions. The study of life in the Universe encompasses many traditional disciplines including Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, and Geology, and has been dubbed the field of "Astrobiology."

<p>In the next Astronomy Open Night, Prof. Alan Calder will discuss the scientific search for life in the Universe. He will describe how our understanding of life on Earth guides the search for life elsewhere and some of the tools utilized in the search. He will present recent results in the search for life in the Universe.

<p>
Alan Calder joined the Stony Brook Physics and Astronomy department
in 2007 after research appointments at the University of Illinois and
the University of Chicago. His research is in numerically modeling
astrophysical phenomena, and he has studied a variety of problems
including core collapse and thermonuclear supernovae, merging neutron
stars, and classical novae.
