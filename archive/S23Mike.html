    <h1>How To Simulate A Star</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Michael Zingale</h2>

  </CENTER>

  <p>
When we look at a star, we see its outer layers -- the processes at
work deep in its interior generating the immense energy are hidden
from our view.  Furthermore, the timescale for stars to evolve is
much longer than human history, so we only see snapshots of stars
in different phases of their evolution.  If we want to understand what
is happening inside of a star and what its fate will be, we need to
build a mathematical model.  These models are complex, so we turn
to computers to solve the detailed set of equations that combine
nuclear reactions, radiation transport, fluid motions, and more.
In this talk, I'll describe some of the details of how these codes
work as well as how the community as a whole develops and manages
these complex codes.

    

  <p>Prof. Zingale is a Professor of Astronomy in Stony Brook's department of Physics & Astronomy. He
joined the Department in 2006, coming most recently from a postdoctoral position at the University of California
at Santa Cruz. His research is in modeling stellar explosions and the basic physics therein, and developing
algorithms for performing supercomputer simulations of astrophysical fluid flow.
