                  <h1>Planet-Hunting with Space Telescopes</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
Large telescopes can produce finer resolution images than small ones.
Space telescopes are much smaller than ground-based telescopes, but they
can still compete when it comes to planet-hunting.  Prof. Sivaramakrishnan
will explain why this is so, explaining the methods used on the Hubble Space
Telescope, and reviewing planet hunting plans for Hubble's successor,
NASA's 6.5 m diameter unfolding infrared James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled
for launch in mid-decade.

<p>
Prof. Sivaramakrishnan has been an adjunct professor at Stony Brook since he moved
to New York in 2005.  He has built instruments for Palomar, Gemini, and other observatories,
worked on Hubble instruments, and implemented a high resolution modification on
the James Webb Space Telescope.  His work enables direct imaging of planets,
protoplanets, disks, and brown dwarfs outside our Solar System.
Prof. Sivaramakrishnan and his family live in Huntington.
