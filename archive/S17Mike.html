    <h1>Computing the Stars</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Michael Zingale</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>Computation bridges observation and theory, and allows one to perform
virtual experiments to help understand the physical processes behind
the astronomical phenomena we see.  Simulations are used across the
range of lengthscales in the Universe, from understanding planetary
processes, the formation and deaths of stars, galaxy structure, and
the large scale structure of the Universe itself.  In this talk I will
summarize the techniques used in computational astrophysics and focus
on simulations of stellar explosions, highlighting the work done here
at Stony Brook.

<p>Prof. Zingale is an Associate Professor of Astronomy in Stony
  Brook's department of Physics and Astronomy.   He joined the Department
  in 2006, coming most recently from a postdoctoral position at
  the University of California at Santa Cruz. His research is in
  modeling stellar explosions and the basic physics therein, and he is
  an expert in numerical hydrodynamics.
