    <h1>Harnessing the Power of the Sun: The Challenges of Terrestrial Fusion</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Michael Zingale</h2>

  </CENTER>

  <p>Stars are powered by thermonuclear fusion&mdash;converting light
  nuclei into heavier ones, releasing an enormous amount of energy
  in the process.  For decades, scientists have sought to replicate
  this power source for commercial generation, but have not yet 
  succeeded in getting more energy out of their reactors than they
  put in.  In this talk, we will discuss the promise of commerical
  fusion and the challenges that must be overcome to make it a 
  reality.

  <p>Prof. Zingale is an Associate Professor of Astronomy in Stony
  Brook's department of Physics and Astronomy.   He joined the Department
  in 2006, coming most recently from a postdoctoral position at
  the University of California at Santa Cruz. His research is in
  modeling stellar explosions and the basic physics therein, and he is
  an expert in numerical hydrodynamics.
