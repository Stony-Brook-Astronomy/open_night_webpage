    <h1>SN2020fqv: observing the death throes of a massive star</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Doug Swesty</h2>

  </CENTER>

  <p>
    Since the 1930's astronomers have speculated that the collapse of a core
    of a massive star might be the mechanism that generates some of the
    massive stellar explosions known as supernovae.   This hypothesis was
    confirmed by the detection of neutrinos
    from a relatively nearby supernova in 1987.    However, little is known
    about the death throes of such a
    massive star in the brief period of time before the core collapses under the force of gravity.
    Fortunately in a space-based mission to observe exoplanet transits, the Transiting
    Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS),  happened to detect a supernova,  SN2020fqv, that is         now giving us an unprecedented view into the behavior of a massive star immediately
    prior to the collapse of it's core.     In this talk we will discuss the theory of how massive
    stars evolve and die and what observations of SN2020fqv are telling us about the death
    throes of such stars.


<p>Prof. Swesty received his PhD in Physics from SUNY Stony Brook in 1993. 
He spent six years at the University of Illinois as a postdoctoral researcher 
and as a Visiting Assistant Professor.   He returned to Stony Brook in 1999 
where he is currently a Research Associate Professor.  His work focuses on 
nuclear astrophysics and computational astrophysics.
