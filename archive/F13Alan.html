                  <h1>The Visit of Comet ISON</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
Comets are relatively small, icy bodies that usually reside in the outer
part of the Solar System. Some comets venture into the inner part of
the Solar System, where heat from the Sun causes evaporation, producing
a visible atmosphere, or coma, and tails of gas and dust. Occasionally,
one will become very bright and produce a fantastic display. Comet ISON
is one such visitor that will make it's closest approach to the Sun
on Nov. 28. In the next of the popular series Astronomy Open Night,
Prof. Alan Calder will talk about comets and the upcoming visit of
Comet ISON.

<P>Prof. Calder joined the Stony Brook Physics and Astronomy department
in 2007 after research appointments at the University of Illinois and
the University of Chicago. His research is in numerically modeling
astrophysical phenomena, and he has studied core collapse and
thermonuclear supernovae, coalescing neutron stars, classical novae,
and X-ray bursts.
