of The Astronomy Club</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
For this week's open night, Matthew Wahl, Jonathan Ullman, Shannon
Hicks, and Adam Siegel will be talking about what observational
projects are being conducted at Mt. Stony Brook; as well as what
other activities The Astronomy Club is involved in. Learn about image
analysis, color filters, using a camera to observe with a telescope,
and the basic fundamentals of a CCD camera.


<p>
The Astronomy Club was formed about two years ago and has been
gaining momentum every since. Dedicated to bringing further
understanding of the universe to the undergraduates of Stony Brook
University, the club meets weekly to keep up with the current events
in astronomy.
