    <h1>Looking For Solar System 2.0<br>
        By Studying Extra Solar Debris Disks</h1>
    <h2>Rahul Patel</h2>

  </CENTER>

  <p>There are over 700 extra-solar planetary systems discovered so
  far and more are being discovered every year, with the hope of
  finding a system of planets similar to our own solar system. But our
  Solar System is composed of not only planets, but two rings of dust
  that make up our Solar System "Debris Disk": the asteroid belt and
  Kuiper belt&mdash;each of which have been shaped by our planets.
  Astronomers have found close to a thousand Solar System-like debris
  disks and those numbers are growing, and with it, comes the hope of
  detecting a system that looks like our own&mdash;maybe even one that
  has an Earth 2.0. In this talk, I will elaborate on the methods of
  detecting extra-solar debris disks and how we can deduce the
  presence of embedded extra-solar planets by looking at the structure
  of the disk!
 
  <p>Rahul Patel is a 5th year graduate student in Astronomy at Stony
  Brook whose research focuses on understanding the evolution and
  occurence rate of debris disks and planetary systems. Rahul
  graduated from Florida Intentional University in Miami and hails
  from both Miami and Toronto.
