    <h1>Blowing in the Ether: Eintstein's Legacy</h1>
    <h2>Prof. James Lattimer</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>Einstein proposed the existence of gravitational waves in 1917,
barely two years after introducing his general theory of relativity.
In this, the centennial year of general relativity, we are on the cusp
of directly observing this radiation, which will open a new window to
our universe.  Ironically, Einstein subsequently had doubts as to the
reality of gravitational radiation.  20 years after proposing them, he
wrote a paper claiming they were unstable and would collapse in on
themselves.  Later, he reversed his position.  In this talk, the
probable sources of gravitational waves, and the instruments that have
been built to detect them, will be described.  Incredibly, the
expected signals are so weak that they will only be detected if
theorists have predicted the correct templates.  Plans to improve and
expand the number of current detectors will also be discussed.

<p>Professor Lattimer has been a faculty member at Stony Brook for 36
years, and was recently named a Distinguished Professor.  He
specializes in the study of neutron stars and black holes.  He has
been awarded the Hans A. Bethe Prize, the highest accolade for nuclear
astrophysics given by the American Physical Society.
