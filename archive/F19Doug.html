    <h1>Our First Look at the Black Hole</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Doug Swesty</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>Recently, the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration revealed our first direct glimpse at the event horizon of a  black hole.   This is incredible  news for astrophysicists as it has taken over a century,  from the time that black holes were first predicted as a consequence of Einstein's theory of gravity, until we were finally able to get a direct view of one.  In this talk I will discuss what a black hole is, how the idea of one was originally discovered, and how we finally, in 2019, have been able to see one directly.



<p>Prof. Swesty received his PhD in Physics from SUNY Stony Brook in 1993. 
He spent six years at the University of Illinois as a postdoctoral researcher 
and as a Visiting Assistant Professor.   He returned to Stony Brook in 1999 
where he is currently a Research Associate Professor.  His work focuses on 
nuclear astrophysics and computational astrophysics.
