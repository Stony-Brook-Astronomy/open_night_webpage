    <h1>The Cosmic Neutrino Background: Capturing the Universe’s Oldest Photograph</hl>
    <h2>Prof. Neelima Sehgal</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p> I will discuss the sea of invisible neutrinos that is all around us and explain its origin.  Then I will discuss how by detecting this sea of particles we could capture the oldest photograph of the Universe — a baby picture when the Universe was one second old.  Finally, I will talk about the significant challenges that exist in capturing this baby picture, and some experiments on the horizon that may achieve this.  

<p>Neelima Sehgal is a Cosmologist in the Physics and Astronomy Department at Stony Brook.  She studies the Cosmic Microwave Background, which is the oldest light in the Universe, to determine what happened during the first few fractions of a second after the Big Bang.  She also studies the Cosmic Microwave Background to discover the properties of neutrinos, dark matter, and dark energy.    She received her B.S. in Physics and Mathematics from Yale University and her PhD in Physics and Astronomy from Rutgers University.   She was a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford and Princeton Universities before joining the faculty at Stony Brook in 2012.
