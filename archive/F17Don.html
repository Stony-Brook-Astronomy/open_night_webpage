    <h1>Saturn in 13 Years: the Cassini-Huygens Mission</h1>
    <h2>Mr Donald Willcox</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>On September 15, 2017, NASA operations staff terminated the NASA/ESA
Cassini-Huygens mission to study the rings, atmosphere, and moons of
Saturn after the Cassini spacecraft exhausted its fuel
supplies. During its 13 year mission, Cassini-Huygens revealed the
potential for life on Saturn's moon Enceladus with striking imagery of
ice plumes breaking out from the moon's surface and studied the
atmosphere and surface of Saturn's moon Titan. The Cassini probe has
also returned detailed imagery that showed Saturn's unique atmospheric
dynamics, including its characteristic hexagonal storm at the northern
pole and the evolution of storms within the atmosphere at lower
latitudes. In this talk, we will look back on these and other exciting
scientific observations from the Cassini-Huygens mission and the feats
of engineering that enabled these discoveries.
