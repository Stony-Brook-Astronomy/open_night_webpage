                  <h1> Measuring Distances in the Universe.</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
An array of techniques are used to measure distances to stars and galaxies in astronomy.  Measuring the
distances to the nearest stars is relatively direct, relying on little more than geometry and careful
observations of stellar positions on the night sky.  The further away an object is, the less direct the
measurement techniques become.  Measuring the distances to the futhest objects know can involve many
assuptions and uncertainties. In this talk I will describe some of the more popular techniques for
measuring distances in astronomy and how techniques for distant objects rely on nearby measurements as
stepping-stones.

<p>
Prof. Zingale is an Assistant Professor of Astronomy in Stony Brook's
department of Physics and Astronomy.  This is his fifth year at
Stony Brook, coming most recently from a postdoctoral position at the
University of California at Santa Cruz. His research is in modeling
stellar explosions and the basic physics therein.
