<p>
Stars are dynamical objects.  As they evolve throughout their
lifetimes, they burn through enormous fuel reserves to produce their
incredible energy output.  As they exhaust one fuel supply, they begin
burning heavier and heavier elements.  For massive stars, this pattern
continues until they run out of fuel, leading to an energetic
core-collapse supernova explosion and leaving behind a neutron star or
black hole.  Low mass stars, like our Sun, ordinarily end their lives
as a dense stellar remnant, a white dwarf, that slowly cools and dims.
However, this is not necessarily the end of the story.  If this
compact remnant (white dwarf or neutron star) is in a binary system,
it can be revived by material flowing onto it from its companion.
This can lead to a host of different explosion scenarios, including
nova and X-ray bursts, as well as thermonuclear supernovae.  It is
also possible that two white dwarfs or neutron stars can merge, with
explosive results.  In this talk, we will survey the wide range of
explosive activity that arises through stellar processes.

Prof. Zingale is an Assistant Professor of Astronomy in Stony Brook's
department of Physics and Astronomy.  This is his sixth year at
Stony Brook, coming most recently from a postdoctoral position at the
University of California at Santa Cruz. His research is in modeling
stellar explosions and the basic physics therein, and he is an
expert in numerical hydrodynamics.
