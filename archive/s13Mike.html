                  <h1>When Asteroids Attack!</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
Recently a meteor blast over Russia caused a lot of damage and even
some injuries.  Where did it come from? and what dangers lie ahead?
In this talk we will talk about the origin of asteroids and comets---the
leftover debris from the formation of the solar system, and what they
tell us about the solar system.  We'll explore the history of impacts on
the planets (including earth) and discuss the dangers of, and potential
solutions to, a future terrestrial impact.

<p>
Prof. Zingale is an Associate Professor of Astronomy in Stony Brook's
department of Physics and Astronomy. This is his seventh year at Stony
Brook, coming most recently from a postdoctoral position at the University
of California at Santa Cruz. His research is in modeling stellar explosions
and the basic physics therein, and he is an expert in numerical
hydrodynamics.
