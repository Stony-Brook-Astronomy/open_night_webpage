                  <h1>Thermonuclear Bombs in Space: The Novae</h1> 

</CENTER>




<p> 
About a dozen times a year an inconspicuous star in our galaxy will
brighten a tenthousandfold, and then slowly fade away. Such stars are called
novae (from the Latin for new stars). Their appearances give lie to the
myth of the constancy of the stars.
The classical novae, distinct from the supernovae, are the visible
manifestations of thermonuclear explosions on the surface of a white dwarf
star in a binary star system. 
I will explain the evolutionary processes that lead some stars to this
precarious state and the basic theory behind the explosion. 
The "nova problem" has long been considered a solved problem in astrophysics. 
But I will present new results from 6 years of monitoring some
southern novae using NASA X-ray telescopes and the SMARTS observatory
that show that the novae still have surprises for us.

Prof. Walter, a resident of East Setauket,
studies star birth, stellar weather, and star death using
the CHANDRA and NEWTON X-ray Observatories, the Hubble Space Telescope,
and telescopes in Hawaii and Chile. He has been a professor of Astronomy
at Stony Brook since 1989.
