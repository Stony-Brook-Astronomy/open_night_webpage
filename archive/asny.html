                  <h1>How to Build a Really Big Telescope</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
Thomas Sebring has been involved in the planning and design of a number of
large astronomical telescopes. He is consulting engineer to the New York
Astronomical Corporation as NYAC considers proposing to build a 12.5m
optical/near-IR telescope to serve the needs of New York State astronomers.
He will tell us how one plans to build a large telescope, and what
considerations go into the design.
