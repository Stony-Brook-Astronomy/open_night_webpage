    <h1>The Life and Death of Massive Stars</h1>
    <h2>Sydney Andrews</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>Mankind has long observed the stars in the night sky. New stars are
continually being born, living their lives, and dying; returning themselves
to the cosmic circle of life. The lives the stars lead depend on how large they
are. Our sun is a relatively average and low mass star. However, massive stars
are less common and live more dramatic lives. 
This talk will follow the life of a massive star: from formation, through its
main phases of life, its dramatic and explosive death as a core-collapse
supernova, and what remains of the star in the cosmos.

<p>Ms. Andrews is a Graduate Research Assistant at Stony Brook University.
She has won the 2018 Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate
Fellowship (DOE CSGF) for work in computational astrophysics and core-collapse
supernovae. A Los Alamos native, she has also held student research
appointments at Los Alamos National Laboratory (2014-2017).
