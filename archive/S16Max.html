    <h1>Seasons in the Sun</h1>
    <h2>Max Katz</h2>

<p>
Our local star plays a key role in supporting life on Earth through a
warm (but not too warm) climate, but there are multiple factors that
determine the nature of Earth's climate. Our atmosphere plays a key
role in mediating the interaction between the Sun's energy and the
Earth's surface, reflecting some of the light and trapping some of it
too. The distance from the Sun plays a big role too, as well as the
orientation of the Earth's rotation axis and the wobbling about that
axis over time. In this talk I will discuss the various factors that
control Earth's climate and contrast Earth's habitability to the stark
inhospitable nature of planets like Venus. We will look at what we
know about the relationship between climatic shifts in the past, and
events like mass extinctions. And we will discuss what is now
happening with global warming, and try to understand how such trace
amounts of greenhouse gases can have such a serious effect on our
climate, as well as put the current warming into historical context.

<p>Max Katz is a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of
Physics and Astronomy at Stony Brook University. He holds an M.S. in
Physics from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Here at Stony Brook,
his research interests are mainly in computational fluid dynamics,
specifically simulations of stars, especially the kinds of stars that
explode.
