<MENU><LI>
The Stony Brook Astronomy group will have a special Open Night
for the transit of Venus on the evening of June 5.
<p>

The start of the event is 5:30 PM with transit beginning at 6:03 PM.
If it is clear, we will have two telescopes set up to observe the
transit in the area between the Math and Physics buildings and the
Simons Center. If it is cloudy, we will have a public lecture on
the transit of Venus in the Simons Center auditorium.
<p>

The Simons Center and Math and Physics buildings are next to the
ESS building, our usual venue.
<p>

Also, for those interested, there is simultaneous Celestial Wine and 
Cheese event at the <A HREF="http://scgp.stonybrook.edu"> Simon's 
Center Cafe </A> from 5:30-9:00 PM ($55).

<br><h1>Briefly, here's what we do:</h1>

<p>During the academic year the Astronomy Program offers a series of
lectures by research faculty on various aspects of Astronomy, most commonly
on their own research or some topic of public interest.  The lectures are
held in Lecture Room 001 (ground floor) of the Earth and Space Sciences
<!--
Building the first Friday of every month<SUP>**</SUP>  
-->
Building the first Friday of every month
at 7:30 pm.
Weather permitting,
viewing using the University's telescopes on the roof of the ESS building
will follow the lectures**.  The lectures are free - at that price, we do not
guarantee the weather - but are not held during periods the University is
in recess: January, June, July and August.  For further information or to
have your name added to the mailing list (postal or e-mail) contact the
Department of Physics and Astronomy at (631) 632-8100, or send e-mail to
<A HREF="mailto:nleoceschapp@notes.cc.sunysb.edu"> Nathan Leoce-Schappin. </A>

<p> Do try to be a little early if you can.  The increasing popularity of
this series has seen the lecture hall full on occasion.  (And when there's
a comet, you can't buy a seat).  Some disability-related accommodations are
available.  Call the Department at the number above before 4 pm to warn us
of your requirements.  If you are not sure how to get here there are <A
HREF="directions.html"> directions and campus maps </A> to help.

The schedule is available (above) along
with short abstracts of the talks and biographic information about the
speakers.  We try to have the abstracts up at least three weeks before each
talk and the calendar up a month before the semester starts.

<p>Our colleagues in Physics, the Geosciences and Ecology and Evolution
have parallel programs of lectures.  Their schedules are found at <A
href="http://mini.physics.sunysb.edu/~marivi/WOP/WOP.php"> <B> The Worlds
of Physics</B></A> (second Friday of the month), <A
href="http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/marinebio/livingworld"> <B>The Living
World</B> </A> (third Friday of the month), and <A
href="http://www.geo.sunysb.edu/openight/index.html"> <B>Geology Open
Night</B></A> (fourth Friday of the month). (They serve coffee!).  These
lectures are also only given during the school year and are held at
7:30pm in ESS 001.

<p><B>Teachers</B> take note.  It may be possible to get <A
HREF="teachers.html"> in-service credit </A> for any or all these
lectures as well as related Geology programs.  The link describes what
is involved.

<p>During those long summer months without your regular monthly Astronomy
Open Night fix, you may want to try this:
<A HREF="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/fwalter/links.html">
Billions of Astronomy Pages.  </A> (When you get done with these you get a
gold star and the link for the next Billion)!

<!--
<p><SUP>**</SUP><a href="calendar.html">Note that this fall there is one exception, October 31.</a>
-->
<p><SUP>**</SUP>Note that because of roof repair, viewing is in the dome is not presently possible.
If it is clear, we will set up small telescopes for viewing.
