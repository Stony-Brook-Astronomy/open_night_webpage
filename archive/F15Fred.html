    <h1>The Once and Future Habitability of Mars</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Fred Walter</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>
Are we decendents of Martians, or will we someday be Martians?

<p>Mars is a small planet, cold, arid, airless, rusted and largely
dead, with half the radius and one-tenth the mass of Earth.  Yet it
was once warm and wet, with a substantial atmosphere. The Mars rovers
have found evidence of substantial surface water - over three billion
years ago. Even today, brine occasionally runs across its surface.
Back when life was struggling to get a toehold on Earth, Mars may have
been an oasis.

<p>I will start with an overview of Mars, its place in the Solar
System, and how it evolved into what it is today. Then I will turn to
humanity's interest in Mars as a potential colony of Earth. From the
Mars One organization's plan to establish a permanent human presence
on Mars in 2027 to NASA's plans to send astronauts in the 2030s, Mars
is in our crosshairs. What is involved in getting there? Can we live
on Mars? What is involved in terraforming a planet? Is the red planet
our future?

<p>Prof. Walter, a resident of East Setauket, studies star birth,
stellar weather, and star death using the CHANDRA and XMM-NEWTON X-ray
Observatories, the Hubble Space Telescope, and telescopes in Arizona,
Hawaii and Chile.  He has been a professor of Astronomy at Stony Brook
since 1989.
