                  <h1>Cosmic Candle Making with Type Ia Supernovae</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
Type Ia supernovae are bright stellar explosions with the
unique property that the light curves may be standardized
and used as distance indicators for cosmological studies. 
Such use as "standard candles" is widely accepted, but
many questions remain about the progenitor systems
and the explosion mechanism.

<p>In the next of the popular series Astronomy Open Night, Prof. 
Alan Calder will present highlights from his research into modeling
type Ia supernova explosions. He will describe proposed progenitor
systems, proposed explosion mechanisms, and the physics involved in 
these events. He will present the results of a study of the systematics 
of type Ia supernovae including trends in brightness following from 
properties of the host galaxy that agree with observations.

<p>Prof. Calder joined the Stony Brook Physics and Astronomy department
in 2007 after research appointments at the University of Illinois
and the University of Chicago. His research is in numerically modeling
astrophysical phenomena, and he has studied core collapse and
thermonuclear supernovae, coalescing neutron stars, and classical
novae.
