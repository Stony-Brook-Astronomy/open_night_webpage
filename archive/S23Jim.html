    <h1>How Recent Nuclear Physics Experiments Impact Neutron Stars</hl>
    <h2>Prof. Jim Lattimer</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>Among recent nuclear physics experiments, the measurements of the
neutron skin thicknesses of Ca-48 (the CREX experiment) and Pb-208
(the PREX experiment) at Jefferson Laboratory have received the most
attention.  In nuclei that have many more neutrons than protons, the
neutrons tend to be pushed outwards relative to the protons to form a
'neutron skin'.  Since it costs energy (called the symmetry energy) to
maintain matter with more neutrons than protons, the greater the
neutron excess and the greater the symmetry energy, the more pressure
matter exerts.  Nuclear models assuming greater symmetry pressure
predict nuclei with greater neutron skin thicknesses compared to other
models, and, analogously, predict neutron stars with larger radii than
other models.  Interestingly, the CREX Ca-48 experiment predicts that
the symmetry pressure is small, while the PREX Pb-208 experiment
predicts the opposite.  I will discuss how nuclear models that best
fit both experimental results, however, turn out to be compatible with
other nuclear experiments, the theory of neutron matter, and
observations of neutron stars from radio, optical, X-ray and
gravitational radiation.  As a result, neutron stars are now
understood better than ever before.
