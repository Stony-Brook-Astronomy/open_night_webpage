    <h1>Why Do Stars Explode?</h1>
    <h2>Michael Zingale</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>Stars can explode in a wide-variety of ways, producing various
   types of supernovae, X-ray bursts, novae, ...  We'll discuss the
   sources of energy a star can tap and when in their lifetime
   they can become explosive.  We'll also discuss what remains
   to be understood about each of these events and how we hope
   to solve these remaining questions.

  <p>Prof. Zingale is an Associate Professor of Astronomy in Stony
  Brook's department of Physics and Astronomy.   He joined the Department
  in 2006, coming most recently from a postdoctoral position at
  the University of California at Santa Cruz. His research is in
  modeling stellar explosions and the basic physics therein, and he is
  an expert in numerical hydrodynamics.
