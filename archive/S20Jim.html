    <h1>Gravitational Waves Galore!</hl>
    <h2>Prof. Jim Lattimer</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>The LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave detections of the first binary black hole
merger, in 2015, and the
first binary neutron star merger, in 2017, opened a new dimension
in observational astronomy.  They not only further
confirmed Einstein's General Theory of Relativity but also validated
long-standing theories of gamma-ray bursts and of heavy element creation.  
Furthermore, they are
revealing new populations of black holes and important
constraints on neutron star structure and the dense matter equation of
state.  The number of detections has increased astronomically in the
last year: to date, over 50 candidates have been observed, including 6 
black hole-neutron star mergers. 
This talk will summarize what has been learned from these discoveries.
