                  <h1>The Hunt for Dark Matter</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
Scientists have an enormous amount of evidence that 80% of the matter
in our Universe is “dark” and unknown.  A broad range of experiments,
ranging from sensitive detectors located deep underground to powerful
instruments on satellites, are searching for signs of this mysterious
matter.  This talk will review the evidence for dark matter and the
exciting scientific quest to uncover its identity.  It will also
explain why we hope to be successful in this quest in the next few
years.

<P>Prof. Essig joined the Stony Brook Physics and Astronomy department
and the Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics in 2012.  Among his
research interests in theoretical particle physics is the nature of
dark matter.
