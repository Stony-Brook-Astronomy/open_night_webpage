    <h1>Gamma-Ray Bursts</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Michael Zingale</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>Gamma-Ray bursts are brief, energetic flashes of gamma-rays.
Discovered by satellites originally designed to detect nuclear weapon
tests on Earth, these events remained mysterious for decades.  We now
know gamma-ray bursts are extragalactic, and fall into two categories:
long and short, each with their own underlying engine.  In this talk,
will discuss the history of gamma-ray bursts, the mechanisms behind
them, and what future observations will tell us.

<p>Prof. Zingale is an Associate Professor of Astronomy in Stony
  Brook's department of Physics and Astronomy.   He joined the Department
  in 2006, coming most recently from a postdoctoral position at
  the University of California at Santa Cruz. His research is in
  modeling stellar explosions and the basic physics therein, and 
  developing the simulation codes for these models.
