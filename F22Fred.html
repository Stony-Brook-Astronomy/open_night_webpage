    <h1>The Dark Side of the Sun</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Frederick Walter</h2>

  <p>
On September 1 1859 one of the largest solar flares ever seen was recorded
by Richard Carrington. A day later a powerful geomagnetic disturbance
was observed, aurorae were seen as far south as Tahiti, and electrical currents
were induced in telegraph lines across North America. This,
the "Carrington Event", was a consequence of one of the largest
coronal mass ejections (CMEs) to strike the Earth in the past 2 centuries.

  <p>
    I will discuss the physics of solar flares and CMEs and their interactions
with Earth. The historical record informs us of the frequency
with which large CMEs strike the Earth, and observations of flares on other
stars let us extrapolate likelihoods of extremely large and rare events. 
The question of another large CME striking is one of when, not if.
The consequences can be devastating for an unprepared society. Are we ready?


<p>Prof. Walter, a resident of East Setauket,
studies star birth, stellar weather, and star death using
the <em>Chandra</em> and XMM-<em>Newton</em> X-ray observatories,
the Hubble Space Telescope, TESS,
and telescopes in Arizona, Hawaii and Chile.
He has been a professor of Astronomy at Stony Brook since 1989.
