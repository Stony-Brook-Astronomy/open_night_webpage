<H1>Directions to Earth and Space Sciences room 001</H1><BR>

You can find the ESS Building and street names on
the <a HREF="http://www.stonybrook.edu/sb/maps.shtml">Campus Map</A>.
The lecture hall is on the ground floor.

<H3>From the North</H3>

<P>From State Route 25A take Nicolls Road south just past the LIRR
underpass (100 yards) and turn right into the North Entrance.  You are
immediately on a short, steep incline which intersects the Circle (Loop)
Road at the top.  Turn right and proceed for almost a mile around the
back of the Campus, passing athletic fields on the left, parking lots
and the LIRR on the right (there's a pedestrian crossing there with a
stop sign), then the power plant and cooling towers on the left and
finally past some dormitories on the right.  At the next (second) stop
sign turn left onto Campus (SAC) Drive (divided) and then immediately
left onto John S. Toll (Center) Drive.  Shortly a right will take you
into a big parking lot.  ESS is the concrete building through the woods
at the far left corner.  Proceed to ESS as described below.

<H3>From the South</H3>

<P> From the LIE take exit 62 (Nicolls Road, <EM>not</EM> Old Nicolls
Road) north.  Go over NYS 25 and through 347 (Nesconset Highway).
After 347 take the left at the second stop light (south entrance to the
west campus).  Follow that a block or so and take the second right
(Marburger [Forest] Drive).  Follow Marburger (Forest) Drive for a half
mile.  When you get to a traffic circle (this is new, Fall 2006) take
it 3/4 of the way around.  Go through three stop signs (stopping, of
course, and careful at the pedestrian cross walks) and take the right
at the fourth stop sign, Campus (SAC) Drive.  Immediately turn left off
that (divided) road.  You are on John S. Toll (Center) Drive and the
first right takes you into a big parking lot.  ESS is the concrete
building through the woods at the far left corner.

<H3>The Lecture Room</H3>

<P>Park as close as you can.  As you walk toward the building you'll
see that the sidewalk takes you through a breezeway under the building.
In the middle of the breezeway to the right (south) is a door, enter there.
Right away there are glass doors into the lecture room, room 001.  That's
where the lectures are held. </P>

<H3>The Telescopes</H3>

<P> From the hall in front of the lecture room you get to the telescopes
as follows: Across from the lecture hall is an open staircase that will
take you up to the main floor.  At the top turn right and go past the
main entrance and over the breezeway. Right after that you will see a
door and stairwell on the right.  That is the set of stairs you want.
Particularly, <B>do not use to the stairs at end of the main hall.</B>
The stairwell there only goes to the roof of the third floor, where you
will not be able to gain access to the telescopes.

<P>Take that center stairwell right to the top.  On exit to the roof
you will see the dome ahead of you.  The entrance is on the far side.

<P>Unless you have a physical condition that requires it (or there are
no more than three or four people involved) we do not recommend taking
the elevator to the 4th floor (here you must still walk up the last
flight of stairs to the roof).  The elevator has had a history of
refusing to go to the 4th floor when heavily loaded.  (They say its "all
fixed now".  If you believe it).
