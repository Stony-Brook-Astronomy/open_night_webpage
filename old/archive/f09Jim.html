                  <h1>When Neutron Stars Collide</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
The collision of two neutron stars might seem like one of the most
unlikely events possible.  After all, a neutron star is no more than
20 miles across while space is vast.  Yet it's been estimated that
about a million of these events occur every year in the observable
universe.  For the most part, these mergers occur in binaries
containing two neutron stars whose orbits are decaying through the
emission of gravitational radiation.  In fact, half a dozen systems
have been observed so far in our Galaxy alone that will merge in less
than a few billion years (one will merge in only 85 million years, a
cosmic blink).  These mergers are not only fun to model, but they are
probably of great consequence.  They are likely to be the most
prodiguous sources of gravitational radiation that will be detected by
the advanced LIGO gravitational wave detector.  They could likely be
the source of the short, hard gamma ray bursts that cannot be
associated with supernovae like the majority of gamma ray bursts.  And
neutron star mergers might be a major source of the r-process
elements, comprising about half of elements heavier than iron, which are
produced in cosmic accelerators of high neutron fluxes.

Professor Lattimer has been teaching and researching at
Stony Brook for thirty years.  Most of his recent research has been in
the area of nuclear astrophysics, the coupling of nuclear physics with
astronomy.  He lives with his family in East Setauket, where he also
pursues the hobby of ferroequinology.
