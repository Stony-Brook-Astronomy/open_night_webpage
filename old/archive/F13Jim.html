                  <h1>New Discoveries About Neutron Stars </h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
Neutron stars are among the most bizarre objects known. They have extreme
densities, temperatures, magnetic field strengths, high-temperature
superfluids and energetic bursts that can affect communications on
the Earth. Evidence is mounting that mergers of neutron stars with each
other or with black holes are the source of short gamma-ray bursts and at
least half of all heavy nuclei, including gold and platinum. This talk
will elaborate on some of the most recent observations and discoveries
concerning neutron stars.

<p>
Dr. James Lattimer is a Distinguished Professor in the Department of
Physics and Astronomy and has been at Stony Brook for nearly 35 years. He
is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and received his PhD from
the University of Texas at Austin on the subject of neutron star mergers.
East Setauket and is interested University of Texas at neutron star merger
