    <h2>The discovery of things that go poof,  burst on the scene, or just
quietly  reveal themselves during the night.</h2><br>

  <p>Every time astronomers have improved their sensitivity to light
     from the cosmos, or sharpened the quality of images they record,
     they have discovered a new aspect of the universe..  Advances in
     instrumentation are now allowing, or will soon allow, astronomers
     to observe the sky nearly continuously with time sensitivity from
     a thousandth of a second to, remarkably, a century.  I will
     discuss the instrumentation that make these advances possible,
     the scientific goals motivating their implementation, and
     speculate on the unknown unknowns waiting to be discovered.

  <p>Emeritus Prof. Simon has been teaching and doing research in
     Astronomy at Stony Brook for almost 40 years and is one of the faculty
     members who founded Astronomy Open Night. His current interests
     include low mass and very young stars and binary systems. He
     lives with his family in Old Field.
