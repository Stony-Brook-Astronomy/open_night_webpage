    <h1>Supermassive black holes: the most powerful and ancient objects in the Universe</h1>
    <h2>Dr. Takamitsu Tanaka</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>
A supermassive black hole has the mass of millions, and sometimes
billions, of Suns. Far from the stuff of science fiction, evidence
suggests that there is one in the center of every galaxyâ€”including our
own. Counter to their name and reputation, they power some of the
brightest phenomena in the Universe, and play major roles in shaping
their cosmic environment. In this talk, I will describe what
astronomers have learned about supermassive black holes (and the
evidence behind this knowledge), as well as open questions that are at
the forefront of current research.

<p>Dr. Takamitsu is a Research Assistant Professor in the Dept. of 
Physics and Astronomy at Stony Brook.  He joined the Dept. in 2014
and works on supermassive black holes and accretion processes.
