   <h1>Now You See Them, Now You Don't:  What Transits Can Tell Us 
        About Extrasolar Planets </h1>

</CENTER>
<p> Over 300 extrasolar planets have been found to date.  Most of them
have been found using the "Doppler wobble" technique, in which
Doppler shifts from their orbital motions around their parent stars
are observed.  However, several other techniques have also been
utilized to find these planets, including microlensing, direct
imaging, timing and transits.  This talk will focus on the detection
of extrasolar planets using the transit technique, in which sensitive
photometry is used to measure the small decrease in brightness (about
1%) of a star when a planet passes in front of it.  This situation
requires that the planet's orbit around the star nearly coincides with
the line-of-sight to the star, so only a small fraction of extrasolar
planets can ever be discovered in this way.  Nevertheless, the transits
themselves reveal important information about the occulting planet that
none of the other techniques can reveal, such as the diameters of the
planets and, in some cases, the compositions and temperatures of their
atmospheres.


<p> Prof. Lattimer has taught and researched at Stony Brook for nearly 30
years, and has received awards from the Alfred B. Sloan and John Simon
Guggenheim Memorial Foundations.  He has also been elected a Fellow of
the American Physical Society.  His research primarily involves
nuclear astrophysics, in particular, the study of neutron stars and
supernovae.
