    <h1>Cosmic Explosions</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Rosalba Perna</h2>

  <p>Stars play a fundamental role in the chemical evolution of the
     Universe, as well as in the development of organic life.  In this
     talk I will review how stars are born, what is that keeps them
     shining, and their ultimate fate when they die. In particular, I
     will discuss the explosive events associated with the death of
     the most massive stars in the Universe, as well as the compact
     objects that they leave behind, that is neutron stars and black
     holes. I will conclude with a summary of the observational
     evidence that has allowed us to identify these remnant objects in
     the Milky Way and in nearby galaxies.

  <p>Rosalba Perna is a theoretical astrophysicist whose main research
     interests are in compact objects, and especially magnetars,
     highly magnetized neutron stars. After a bachelor in Physics in
     Italy studying condensed matter, she came to the US for her PhD,
     and her interests shifted towards the Physics of the Universe.
     She has been at Stony Brook since January 2014, after being a
     faculty for almost 10 years at the University of Colorado at
     Boulder.
