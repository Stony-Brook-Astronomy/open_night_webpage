    <h1>The History and Evolution of the Universe</h1>
    <h2>Dr. Alexander van Engelen</h2>

  </CENTER>

  <p>Over the past several decades, cosmologists have settled on a
  coherent picture for the evolution of our Universe.  At its earliest
  stages the Universe was very hot, dense, and featureless, and was
  expanding very rapidly; today, the Universe is mostly cold and
  empty, but contains a rich structure of galaxies arranged in huge
  filaments and clusters.  In this talk, I will give an overview of
  our understanding of the course of cosmic history, starting from
  when the Universe was only a few minutes old, and going right
  through to today.

  <p>Alexander van Engelen is a postdoctoral researcher in the
  Department of Physics and Astronomy whose research involves
  developing theoretical cosmological models and applying them to
  data.  He is originally from Vancouver, Canada, and received his PhD
  in 2013 from McGill University in Montreal.
