<p> 
With the End of the World perhaps less than a year way, I will take
a look at the history, speculations, and science behind some of the
projections for the year that marks the end of the Mayan calendar. I
will present recent developments in archaeoastronomy, planetary 
astronomy, and geology for an up-to-date factual context, and will use 
them as a guide in analyzing the realm of possible projections.

Prof. Metchev came to Stony Brook as an assistant professor in 2008. 
His research focuses on extrasolar planets, brown dwarfs, and nearby 
young stars.
