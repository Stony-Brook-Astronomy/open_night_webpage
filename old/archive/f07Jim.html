                       <h1>The Top of Astronomy: Pulsars</h1>

</CENTER>
<p>Pulsars are the most rapidly rotating objects observed, some
spinning as fast as 700 times per second.  Considering these are
neutron stars, each wider than Manhattan, that is fast, indeed.  They
emit rays of energy, in radio, optical and/or x-radiation, that sweep
past us like lighthouse beams. Pulsars appear to be highly magnetic,
with fields up to a quadrillion Gauss.  Over 1700 pulsars have been
cataloged.  Dozens are known in binary systems, and many of these have
been weighed.  Some pulsars are speeding through space at over 3
million miles per hour!

<p>In the next of the popular series Astronomy Open Night, Prof. James
Lattimer will describe the observed properties of pulsars and what has
been deduced about their origin, structure and evolution.  Some special
pulsars will be examined more closely, including the first one
discovered, the fastest spinning, the fastest moving, the most massive,
the most magnetized, the closest, the oddest, the one with the
first-discovered extra-solar planets, and the one that emitted the
largest burst of radiation ever recorded in our Galaxy.

<p>Dr. Lattimer is a Professor of Physics & Astronomy.  He has been at
Stony Brook, living in East Setauket, for over 25 years, and is a
former chairman of the Earth and Space Sciences Department.  He is a
Fellow of the American Physical Society.
