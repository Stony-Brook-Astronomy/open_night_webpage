                  <h1> Standard supernovas and the future of the Universe.</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
In the early 20th century when astronomers 
 realized that the Universe was expanding.  Since 
 that time one of the most profound questions we 
 have puzzled over is "What is the future of the Universe?".
 Our ideas about this have changed rapidly over the 
 past two decades as we have developed a method 
 of using supernovae to measure the distance to 
 galaxys.      This has lead us to the surprising result
 that the Universe is accelerating it's rate of expansion.
 This talk will explain these ideas and concepts that
 are behind our rapidly changing view of the cosmos.

<p>
Prof. Swesty has been associated with astronomy at Stony Brook for
twenty one years, initially as a graduate student and then, after 5 years
at the University of Illinois, returning as a faculty member.  He
has studied core collapse supernovae, neutron stars, the behavior
of neutron stars  in close binary systems, and the properties
of neutron star material.
