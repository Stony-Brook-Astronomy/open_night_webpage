<p>Supernovae are the spectacular explosions that signal violent stellar
deaths. These fascinating events involve many branches of physics and are
some the most powerful explosions observed in the cosmos. Supernovae
produce and disseminate heavy nuclei, trigger star formation, and some
cases are the birthplace of interesting astrophysical objects such
as pulsars and black holes.

<p>In the next of the popular series Astronomy Open Night, Prof. Alan
Calder will discuss supernovae and his research into modeling
these explosions. He will describe the classification of supernovae,
proposed mechanisms for the explosions, and the physics involved
in these events.

<p>Prof. Calder joined the Stony Brook Physics and Astronomy department
in 2007 after research appointments at the University of Illinois
and the University of Chicago. His research is in numerically modeling
astrophysical phenomena, and he has studied core collapse and
thermonuclear supernovae, coalescing neutron stars, and classical
novae.
