   <h1>From Stars to Planets</h1>

</CENTER>
<p> The meteoritic and cratering record in our Solar System indicates that
planet formation around the young Sun was a turbulent affair,
characterized by frequent and catastrophic collisions between the
nascent planetesimals. Unfortnately, today's geological evidence only
offers an approximate extrapolation of the conditions that existed in
that exciting and scientifically important epoch in the life of the
Solar System, >4 billion years ago.  However, over the past two decades,
astronomers have gathered a wealth of new information on other nearby
stars that are much younger than the Sun and that appear to be currently
undergoing active planet formation and meteoritic bombardment.  Such
young stars have offered unprecedented views of the early life of the
Solar System, and have created a very concrete context for our own
existence on Earth.  I will overview the scientific methods and evidence
on which we base our knowledge of planet formation around other stars,
and will draw parallels with the Solar System.  I will showcase some of
the newest astronomical data from the Keck and the VLT telescopes, and
from the Hubble and the Spitzer space telescopes, that have provided
support for the current hypotheses on planetary system evolution.
Finally, I will use recent observations to offer a glimpse into the final
evolutionary stages of a planetary system, following the death of its host
star.

<p> Stanimir Metchev recently joined the faculty at Stony Brook as an
assistant professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy.  Prior
to that, he received his Ph.D. from the California Institute of
Technology in 2005, and spent three years as a postdoctoral research
fellow at UCLA.  His scientific interests lie in the fields of the
formation an evolution of extrasolar planetary systems and of very
low-mass brown dwarfs.
