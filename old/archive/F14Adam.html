    <h1>(Super)computing the Stars</h1>

  <p>We can't set off a supernova on Earth, or smash two large black
  holes together in a controlled scientific experiment.  This makes
  some of astronomy's most interesting questions difficult to tackle.
  We've achieved amazing understanding from looking out into space
  with increasingly complex telescopes, but a new tool has emerged in
  recent decades: massively parallel supercomputers.  In this Open
  Night I'll lay out some of the history of computing in science,
  describe what exactly a modern supercomputer is like, and give you a
  glimpse into how scientists use them to do the impossible: setting
  off supernovae, merging black holes, and building galactic
  structures&mdash;all from the comfort of our office desk, right here
  on Earth.

  <p>Adam Jacobs is a graduate student in the Department of Physics 
     and Astronomy at Stony Brook working on modeling helium ignition
     in accreted shells on white dwarfs as a model for Type Ia supernovae.
