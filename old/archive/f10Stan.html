of Comparative Exoplanetology</h1> 

</CENTER>




<p> 
Only two years ago astronomical high-contrast imaging technology enabled
the much anticipated direct imaging detection of extrasolar planets.
These first images of other planetary systems unequivocally demonstrated
what has been suggested by Doppler planet-search techniques for over 15
years: that our own solar system is far from unique in our galaxy.
Still, the routine imaging of planets around other stars remains beyond
the reach of current telescope technology.  High-contrast imaging
through the Earth's turbulent atmosphere is fraught with challenges.
The requisite imaging precision, of order 1 part in 10 million, has so
far been attained only in carefully controlled laboratory environments.

<p> 
The situation is due to change in 2011 with the arrival of the first
extreme contrast imaging systems on astronomical telescopes.  The Gemini
Planet Imager on the Gemini South 8m telescope, and the PALM-3000
instrument on the Palomar 5m telescope, will inaugur an era when the
imaging of extrasolar planets and the spectroscopic study of their
atmospheres will become routine.  Stony Brook astronomers are involved
in the science planning for both of these instruments.  I will surmise
some of the exciting discoveries that we anticipate to make with these
cutting-edge facilities, and will preview what we expect to learn about
our own planetary system as a result.

<p> 
Prof. Metchev arrived at Stony Brook as an assistant professor in 2008.
His research focuses on extrasolar planets, brown dwarfs, and nearby
young stars.  He lives with his family in Huntington.
