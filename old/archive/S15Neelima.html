    <h1>Illuminating Dark Matter, Neutrinos, and Inflation using the Oldest Light in the Universe</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Neelima Sehgal</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>I will discuss how the oldest light in the Universe, the cosmic
microwave background radiation, can unravel the secrets of dark matter
and the masses of the elusive neutrino particles. I will also discuss
how this light, which is collected using a microwave telescope in the
Atacama desert in Chile, is being used to tell us information about
the first fraction of a second after the Big Bang.

<p>Prof. Neelima Sehgal has been an Assistant Professor in the Physics
and Astronomy Department at Stony Brook University since 2012. Her
research interests include understanding dark energy, dark matter,
neutrino properties, and the early Universe.
