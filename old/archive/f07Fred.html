<p>The telescope is the basic instrument used by observational
astronomers.  Telescopes collect and focus light. The concept is
simple; the implementations can be very complex. Since the emissions of
stars, galaxies, and planets are not confined to visible light, we also
construct telescopes that work at wavelengths from X-rays and Gamma
rays to radio waves.  Telescopes are found on the surface of the Earth,
on mountaintops, in Earth orbit, and drifting through the Solar
System. Telescopes range from small spotter scopes (diameters of an inch or
less) to the 10 meter diameter Keck reflectors, and there are plans to
build telescope with 100 meter diameter mirrors.  The result is a
bewildering assortment of technology all devoted to the single-minded
pursuit of capturing the elusive photon.

<p>In the next of the popular series Astronomy Open Night, Prof. Fred
Walter will remind us what a telescope really is and how it came to be.
After an historical overview of the tools of observational astronomy,
Dr. Walter will describe how the state of the art in telescopy has
advanced since the time of Galileo.  Plans for the next generation
instruments will be described.

<p>Dr. Walter, a resident of East Setauket, studies star birth, stellar
weather, and star death using the CHANDRA and NEWTON X-ray
Observatories, the Hubble Space Telescope, and telescopes in Hawaii and
Chile. He has been a Professor of Astronomy at Stony Brook since 1989.
