                  <h1>The Discovery of Superfluidity in the Core of a Neutron Star</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
X-ray emission from the neutron star remnant of the 1680 supernova
explosion in the constellation of Cassiopeia was the "first light"
observed with the Chandra X-ray Telescope in 1999.  This neutron star is
now at the center of an expanding plasma known as Cas A.  The analysis
of 2000-2010 data from Cas A revealed that the neutron star is cooling
more than 15 times faster than originally expected.  A team composed
of researchers, all of whom had close ties to Stony Brook, showed that
this rapid cooling could be explained by to the onset, less than 30 years
earlier, of neutron superfluidity in the star's core.  (A competing team
of Russians also suggested this explanation.)  A superfluid is a novel
state of matter, with bizarre properties, in which particles weakly pair
with each other.  In terrestrial matter, superfluids usually form only
within tens of degrees of absolute zero, but in a neutron star interior,
they are expected to form below about a half billion degrees Kelvin.
In the case of neutrons, which are fermions, the pairs, called Cooper
pairs, are bosons.  As the internal temperature falls below the superfluid
critical temperature, Cooper pairs form and then break due to thermal
fluctuations.  The continued formation and breaking of Cooper pairs
drives neutrino emissions that cool the star.  It is expected that
the observed enhanced cooling will continue for about 100 more years,
but within about 30 years we should observe a noticeable change in the
cooling rate.  This is the first time that the surface temperature of
a neutron star that is not a source of X-ray bursts has been observed
to change in real time, and the first solid evidence of superfluidity
in a neutron star's deep interior.

James Lattimer, a professor of Physics and Astronomy at Stony Brook
University, has a long-standing interest in neutron stars, including
their structure, composition, formation and evolution.  He is a Fellow
of the American Physical Society.  Also a ferroequinologist, he enjoys
observing with his $10 Dobsonian telescope on Camano Island.
