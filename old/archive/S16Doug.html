    <h1>New Clues About the Origins of Core-Collapse Supernovae</h1>
    <h2>Doug Swesty</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>In recent years a wealth of new observational data has given
   astrophysicists an unprecedented look at the variety of outcomes
   that can arise from the collapse of the core of a massive
   star. With new observational techniques providing more data we have
   come to realize that there are many types of supernovae that arise
   from a stellar core-collapse.  I will discuss how our picture of
   what happens when a stellar core collapses has evolved with time
   and the recent observational evidence that is leading us to this
   new viewpoint.

<p>Prof. Swesty has been associated with astronomy at Stony Brook for
   more than twenty five years, initially as a graduate student and
   then, after 5 years at the University of Illinois, returning as a
   faculty member. He has studied core collapse supernovae, neutron
   stars, the behavior of neutron stars in close binary systems, and
   the properties of neutron star material.
