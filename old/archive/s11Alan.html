                  <h1>Fires and Floods on White Dwarfs: A Nova Model</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
Last fall Professor Fred Walter gave an Open Night talk on one
class of stellar explosions known as Classical Novae
(<A HREF= "http://astro.sunysb.edu/openight/archive/f10Fred.html">linked here</A>). 
In the next talk of the Open Night series, Prof. Calder will offer
the theory perspective on Classical Novae. He will present the
most widely accepted explosion model, an exploding hydrogen atmosphere on
the surface of a carbon/oxygen white dwarf,  and discuss the incompletely
understood mixing of carbon and oxygen into the atmosphere thought
to enhance the thermonuclear burning in the atmosphere.

<p>
Prof. Calder joined the Stony Brook Physics and Astronomy department
in 2007 after research appointments at the University of Illinois
and the University of Chicago. His research is in numerically modeling
astrophysical phenomena, and he has studied core collapse and
thermonuclear supernovae, coalescing white dwarfs, and classical
novae.
