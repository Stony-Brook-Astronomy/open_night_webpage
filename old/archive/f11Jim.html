                  <h1>Black Holes Large and Small.</h1>

<p> 
There is overwhelming evidence that our universe is filled with black
holes, objects so compact that their escape velocities exceed the
speed of light and nothing can escape from within them. Around a
black hole there is a surface called an event horizon that marks the
point of no return. Astrophysically detected black holes range in
size from several times the mass of the sun to many billions of solar
masses. The evidence largely comes from measuring the motion of
objects orbiting these black holes, coupled with their invisibility in
radiation. Although it is believed that stellar-sized black holes are
the aftermath of particularly massive supernovae, it is not understood
how supermassive black holes form. What roles do black holes play in
the universe? Will we be able to directly see the event horizon of a
black hole? Will we be able to observe them in gravitational
radiation? These are some of the questions which will be discussed in
this talk.

Fellow of the American Physical Society. He also studies
ferroequinology and lives in East Setauket.
