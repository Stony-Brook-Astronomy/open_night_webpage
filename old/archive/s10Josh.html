                  <h1> All the Neighbors are Moving!: Astrometry in the Solar Neighborhood</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
All stars, including the Sun, are moving through the galaxy. This 
talk will introduce astrometry, the measure and study of stellar motions, 
and discuss what we can learn from these measurements. Modern high 
precision measurement techniques and individual stars at the extremes 
of astrometry will be highlighted. I will also detail my use of 
astrometry in the study of very young nearby stars with common motion 
through the galaxy, known as moving groups
