                       <h1>Is Pluto a Planet?</h1>

</CENTER>
<p>Pluto has long been understood to be a misfit as a planet among its
giant planet neighbors. The possibility of better understandingits
nature arrived with the discovery of the Kuiper Belt Objects in the
mid-1990's.  Pluto's status came to a head with discoveries of Kuiper
Belt Objects sharing Pluto's characteristics and the vote in 2006 of
the General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union to
declassify Pluto as one of the 9 classical planets. The vote
engendered a surprisingly strong response from astronomers and the
public alike.

<p>In the next of the popular series Astronomy Open Night, Prof. Michal
Simon will present the arguments for and against the decision to
declassify Pluto.  In the process he will address the larger question
``What is a Planet (Anyway)?", which is still being debated by the
astronomical community.

<p>Prof. Simon has been teaching and doing research in Astronomy at Stony
Brook for 38 years and is one of the facutly members who founded
Astronomy Open Night.  His current interests include low mass and very
young stars and binary systems.  He lives with his family in Old Field.
