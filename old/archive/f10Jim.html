<p> 
Many new observations of neutron stars, including binary pulsars, hot
neutron stars, and explosions on neutron star surfaces, are providing a
wealth of information about them.  In particular, we are learning about the
range of masses and radii they have.   It is possible to combine the
information from different stars to decipher the underlying equation of
state of dense matter.  What we have learned is compared to studies of
nuclei and studies of pure neutron matter from the laboratory.  Come to the
talk to find out what we are learning.

<p> 
Prof. Lattimer has studied dense nuclear matter, neutron stars and
supernovae at Stony Brook for over 30 years.  He lives in East Setauket.
