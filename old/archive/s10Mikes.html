                  <h1>Where Are We?</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
The universe is incomprehensibly vast. We are located on
a sand pile formed recently on a beautiful planet in the suburbs
of our galaxy. In this lecture, "Where are We?", Dr. Simon will
describe our place in the universe starting right here, continuing
past the nearest stars, some of which are known to host planets,
outwards through the local group of galaxies, and on to the
limits ov the observable universe.

<p>
Prof. Simon has been teaching and doing research in Astronomy at Stony
Brook for 38 years and is one of the faculty members who founded Astronomy 
Open Night. His current interests include low mass and very young stars and 
binary systems. He lives with his family in Old Field.
