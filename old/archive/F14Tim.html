    <h1>Science and Exploration of the Moon enabled by Stony Brook's RIS4E Team</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Tim Glotch</h2>

  <p>The Remote, In Situ, and Synchrotron Studies for Science and
  Exploration (RIS4E) team is one of nine nodes of NASAâ€™s new Solar
  System Exploration and Research Virtual Institute. Our team is
  addressing key aspects of the science and exploration of the Moon
  and other Solar System bodies Using a comprehensive approach to
  better understand the spectral data of samples and surfaces, how we
  will one day safely explore those surfaces, and in turn maximize our
  measurements of all samples, especially small, precious returned
  samples, RIS4E will produce a wealth of information and a team of
  well-trained next generation scientists.This talk, as a celebration
  of International Observe the Moon Night, will provide an overview of
  the five-year RIS4E effort, which is divided into four main research
  themes. These themes are:
  <ol>
   <li>Preparation for Exploration: Enabling Quantitative Remote
   Geochemical Analysis of Airless Bodies. The RIS4E team is engaging
   in studies of remote sensing targets of opportunity, and
   experimental and theoretical studies to optimize the interpretation
   of remote sensing data sets, including experimental space
   weathering studies, simulated lunar/asteroid environment
   spectroscopic measurements, and tests of advanced spectral unmixing
   techniques.</li>

   <li>Maximizing Exploration Opportunities: Development of Field
   Methods for Human Exploration. Science-motivated field work is
   helping us evaluate the role of handheld and portable field
   instruments for future human exploration of the Moon, enabling
   rapid, low-risk, comprehensive, and quantitative assessments of the
   local geology and regolith materials.</li>

   <li>Protecting our Explorers: Understanding How Planetary Surface
   Environments Impact Human Health. Future astronauts will be exposed
   to harsh environments on the Moon, with potentially harmful but
   unknown health effects. The RIS4E team is performing experiments to
   determine the reactivity and toxicity of lunar analog materials,
   and, eventually, actual lunar samples.</li>

   <li>Maximizing Science from Returned Samples: Advanced Synchrotron
   and STEM Analysis of Lunar and Primitive Materials. The National
   Synchrotron Light Source II at Brookhaven National Laboratory will
   be open to conduct experiments in the fall of 2014. This
   next-generation light source will provide unparalleled chemical and
   mineralogical analysis of precious lunar and primitive materials,
   which the RIS4E team is taking advantage of to tightly constrain
   the oxygen content of the early Solar System.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Timothy Glotch is an Associate Professor in the Department of
  Geosciences at Stony Brook, where he has been since 2007. He
  completed his Ph.D. in Geosciences at Arizona State University in
  2004 and was a postdoc at Caltech from 2005-2007. His research is
  focused on using laboratory spectroscopic techniques and
  sophisticated light scattering models to enable more quantitative
  interpretation of spectroscopic data sets. This work includes using
  laboratory visible/near-infrared reflectance, thermal infrared
  emission, and Raman spectroscopies, both on remote sensing platforms
  and in the laboratory, to determine the composition of geologic
  materials on the surfaces of the Moon, asteroids, Mars, and its
  moons. He has received NASA group achievement awards for his work
  with the Odyssey THEMIS and MER Mini-TES instruments that have flown
  to Mars and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Diviner Lunar
  Radiometer Experiment. He is a Co-Investigator on Diviner, which has
  been orbiting the Moon since 2009. In 2012, he was awarded the
  National Science Foundation Early Career Award. He is the Principal
  Investigator of the $5.5M Remote, In Situ, and Synchrotron Studies
  for Science and Exploration (RIS4E) team, which is part of NASA's
  Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI).
