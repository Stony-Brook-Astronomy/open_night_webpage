                  <h1>Finding Planets Around Bright Stars</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
JWST - the James Webb Space Telescope - has a mirror made of 18
different reflectors. Once assembled in space, it spans 21 feet, but
JWST's primary mirror is actually folded up into a package for launch.
How on earth do we plan to unfold it, align it, and start using it?
I will describe how we address this huge challenge, and present two
key scientific areas JWST targets: measuring the colors of planets
around distant stars, and probing close to supermassive black holes
that fuel active galaxies' central engines

<p>
Prof. Anand Sivaramakrishnan has worked on developing specialized
astronomical instruments that observe very faint objects very close to
bright stars. He lived in Huntington for several years, and is now
based in Baltimore, at the Space Telescope Science Institute (which
runs the Hubble). He has been involved in building JWST for the last
decade.
