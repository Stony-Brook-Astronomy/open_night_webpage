    <h1>Solar Storms and the Threat to Earth</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Michael Zingale</h2>

  </CENTER>


  <p>Our Sun has active and quiet phases, driven by complex changes in
  its magnetic field.  When it is active, outbursts of hot plasma can
  occur, and if these outbursts are pointed toward Earth, our
  communication satellites and power grid can experience problems or
  outright fail.  In this lecture, we'll discuss the Sun's magnetic
  activity, its quiet and active phases, and look at some historical
  solar outbursts that have impacted Earth.

  <p>Prof. Zingale is an Associate Professor of Astronomy in Stony
  Brook's department of Physics and Astronomy. This is his eight year
  at Stony Brook, coming most recently from a postdoctoral position at
  the University of California at Santa Cruz. His research is in
  modeling stellar explosions and the basic physics therein, and he is
  an expert in numerical hydrodynamics.
