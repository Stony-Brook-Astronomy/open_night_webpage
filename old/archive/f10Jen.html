                  <h1>Observing Galaxies Large and Small with the Hubble Space Telescope </h1> 

</CENTER>




<p> 
Some of the most breathtaking images recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) have been those of large, star-forming, nearby galaxies. While these
have lent great insight to the field, some of the most important
observations by HST have been of tiny galaxies in our local neighborhood and
extremely distant galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. In this talk, I'll
explain the differences between various kinds of galaxies and describe some
of the valuable lessons that HST has taught us. And, considering that it's a
Hubble talk, you can bet that there will be a bunch of pretty pictures.

Jennifer Donovan Meyer joined the Stony Brook Physics and Astronomy
Department a year ago as a Postdoctoral Research Associate after finishing
her Ph.D at Columbia University. Her research interests include studies of
star formation and gas within and surrounding galaxies.
