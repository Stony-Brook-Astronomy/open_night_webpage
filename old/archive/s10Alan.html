</CENTER>

<p> Mars has long captured mankind's imagination. Although hostile
invaders from Mars has been a common theme in science fiction,
we now know that the is certainly no advanced life on Mars.
Mars continues to be explored through a variety of missions,
teaching us more about Mars, the Solar System, and 
planetary habitability. 
In the next of the popular series Astronomy Open Night, Prof. Alan
Calder will chart the exploration of Mars. He will describe the
history of the study of Mars, contemporary missions, and future
efforts, including a description of the difficulties associated
with a manned mission.

<p> 
Prof. Calder joined the Stony Brook Physics and Astronomy department
in 2007 after research appointments at the University of Illinois
and the University of Chicago. His research is in numerically modeling
astrophysical phenomena, and he has studied core collapse and
thermonuclear supernovae, coalescing white dwarfs, and classical
novae.
