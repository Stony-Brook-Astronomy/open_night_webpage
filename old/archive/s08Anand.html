                  <h1>A Clearer View of the Skies using Adaptive Optics</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>Telescopes placed on the surface of the Earth have to contend with the
turbulent atmospheric heat haze that blurs their images.  Space telescopes
like Hubble are extremely expensive solutions to this problem.  Over the
last decade astronomers have developed the technique of Adaptive Optics
to give ground-based telescopes even higher resolution than Hubble.
Adaptive Optics has delivered exciting results on volcanic activity on
Jupiter's moon Io, discovered intriguing structure around nearby stars,
and revealed stellar orbits around the massive black hole at the center
of our own galaxy.  It has enabled us to improve our understanding of
the life cycle of nearby stars, and study planetary formation outside
the Solar System.  It even helps medical doctors to image the retinas
of our eyes more clearly!

<p>Prof. Sivaramakrishnan will explain how Adaptive Optics works.  He will
describe why ground-based adaptive optics enables sharper images than
space telescopes, and why space telescopes are still essential for
certain kinds of astronomy.

<p>Prof. Sivaramakrishnan has been an adjunct professor at Stony Brook
since he moved to New York in 2005 to join the American Museum of Natural
History's Astrophysics Department.  He has built instruments for Palomar
and other observatories, and has worked on Hubble instruments as well
as the planned James Webb Space Telescope.  He is engaged in enabling
the direct imaging of planets and brown dwarfs outside our Solar System.
Prof. Sivaramakrishnan lives with his family in Huntington.
