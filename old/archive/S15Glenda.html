    <h1>Women in Astronomy</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Glenda Denicol&oacute; (SCCC)</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>Women have played key roles in Astronomy since the ancient times of
Babylon and Alexandria. Nonetheless, if you ask the public to name
some astronomers throughout history, they will most likely list men.
In this talk, we will look into the rich history of contributions of
women to astronomy.  More time will be dedicated to important
discoveries made by Henrietta Swan Leavitt, Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin,
Vera Cooper Rubin, Susan Jocelyn Bell Burnell, and Carolyn Porco. All
of them have sometimes struggled with society’s ideas of women’s
"appropriate roles". Each woman’s challenges were different and met in
their own way.  They are inspiring role models for the next generation
of women in astronomy, who can feel welcome to the club.

<p>Glenda Denicolo has PhD in Astronomy from the University of
Cambridge, UK. She currently teaches physics at Suffolk County
Community College, NY.
