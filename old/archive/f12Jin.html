                  <h1>Lights, Telescopes, and Interferometers</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
This talk is about what light is, how it is detected in telescopes, and how astronomy interferometers work.



<p>
Prof. Koda is an Assistant Professor of Astronomy in Stony Brook's department of Physics and Astronomy. 
Prior to Stony Brook, he had research appointments at Caltech and the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.
He studies the gas dynamical evolution of galactic disks, with an emphasis on star formation and 
interstellar medium (ISM) evolution. He is primarily a millimeter-wave radio astronomer, but employs both 
observational and theoretical approaches to explore gas structure, dynamics, and star formation over global 
galactic disks.
