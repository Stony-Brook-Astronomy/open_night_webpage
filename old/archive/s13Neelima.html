                  <h1>Dark Energy and the Accelerating Universe</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
The evidence for Dark Energy is overwhelming.  Already in the mid
1970s, astronomical data hinted at the possibility of an additional
energy component in the Universe.  This Dark Energy would accelerate
the expansion rate of our Universe and counteract the pull of gravity.
By the late 1990s, the evidence for Dark Energy became compelling when
astronomers directly measured this accelerated expansion.   Since then,
the evidence for this energy component has been continually growing from
measurements employing many independent techniques.


<p>
In this talk, I will review the evidence for Dark Energy and discuss how
its existence raises even deeper questions about our Universe.  I will
then discuss the forefront of current research on Dark Energy and the
giant telescopes astronomers are using to further understand its nature.


<p>
Prof. Neelima Sehgal has been an Assistant Professor in the Physics and
Astronomy Department at Stony Brook University since 2012.  Her research
interests include understanding dark energy, dark matter, neutrino
properties, and the early Universe.
