                  <h1>Finding Planets Around Bright Stars</h1>

</CENTER>

<p>
Astronomers now know about more than 700 exoplanets and
another couple thousand await confirmation.  The planetary
systems they form are totally unlike ours.  Jupiter-sized planets
orbiting their stars with periods of a few days, other systems with
planets orbiting in a direction opposite to that of the rotation of
the star,  multi-planet systems with a range of orbital inclinations,
and an exoplanet orbiting a stellar binary.   These discoveries challenge
astronomers' understanding of planet formation; Dr. Simon will describe
how theorists are struggling to keep up with the treasure of new discoveries.
