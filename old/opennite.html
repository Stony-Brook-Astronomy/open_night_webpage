<p>&nbsp;
<br><h2>Briefly, here's what we do:</h2>

<p>During the academic year the Astronomy Program offers a series of
lectures by research faculty on various aspects of Astronomy, most commonly
on their own research or some topic of public interest.  The lectures are
held in Lecture Room 001 (ground floor) of the Earth and Space Sciences
<!--
Building the first Friday of every month<SUP>**</SUP>  
-->
Building the first Friday of every month
at 7:30 pm.
Weather permitting,
viewing using the University's telescopes on the roof of the ESS building
will follow the lectures.

<p>The lectures are free&mdash;at that price, we do not
guarantee the weather&mdash;but are not held during periods the University is
in recess: January, June, July and August.  For further information or to
have your name added to the mailing list (postal or e-mail) contact the
Department of Physics and Astronomy at (631) 632-8100, or send e-mail to
<A HREF="mailto:nleoceschapp@notes.cc.sunysb.edu"> Nathan Leoce-Schappin. </A>

<p> Do try to be a little early if you can.  The increasing popularity of
this series has seen the lecture hall full on occasion.  (And when there's
a comet, you can't buy a seat).  Some disability-related accommodations are
available.  Call the Department at the number above before 4 pm to warn us
of your requirements.  If you are not sure how to get here there are <A
HREF="directions.html"> directions and campus maps </A> to help.

The schedule is available (above) along
with short abstracts of the talks and biographic information about the
speakers.  We try to have the abstracts up at least three weeks before each
talk and the calendar up a month before the semester starts.


<p><B>Teachers take note</B>: It may be possible to get <A
HREF="teachers.html"> in-service credit </A> for any or all these
lectures.
