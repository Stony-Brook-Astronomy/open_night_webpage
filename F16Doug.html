    <h1>Ripples in Space-time: Detecting Gravitational Waves</h1>
    <h2>Prof. Douglas Swesty</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>During past year physicists and astronomers have, for the first
time, directly detected gravitational waves.  This phenomena, which
was predicted over a century earlier by Albert Einstein as a part of
his formulation of the General Theory of Relativity, has proven
extremely difficult to observe because of the properties of gravity.
However, a nearly half-century long effort culminating in the Laser
Interferometric Gravitational Observatory (LIGO) experiment, funded by
the National Science Foundation, has now detected at least
gravitational wave events that are believed to be the result of the
coalesence of two black holes into a single larger black hole.  In
this talk we will discuss both the theory and experimental effort to
verify the existence of gravitational waves.

<p>Doug Swesty is a Research Associate Professor in the Department of
Physics and Astronomy at Stony Brook.  After obtaining his PhD at
Stony Brook in 1993 he spent six years at the Universitty of Illinois
as a staff member of the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications and as a Visiting Research Assistant Professor in the
Department of Astronomy.  He returned to Stony Brook in 1999 where he
teaches and conducts research in the areas of computational and
nuclear astrophysics.
