    <h1>Black Holes from Early Speculations to Modern Astrophysics</h1>
    <h2>Dr. Simone Dall'Osso</h2>

  </CENTER>

<p>Black holes are one of the most enigmatic and fascinating celestial
bodies, that we can now observe&mdash;indirectly and
directly&mdash;thanks to modern instruments able to reveal them both
in high-energy radiation and even in gravitational wave emission.  The
history of the <em>black hole idea</em> can somehow be dated back to
the physics of the XVIII century. However, a proper and meaningful
understanding only became possible more than one century later, thanks
to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. Apparently, Einstein
himself considered black holes as a mere mathematical oddity of his
theory, with no real physical meaning.  Although a black hole does not
allow any type of radiation (nor information) to escape its interior
(the so-called
<em>event horizon</em>), its presence strongly affects matter and even
the structure of space-time in its surrounding. It is these
<em>secondary</em> effects that we can reveal and measure with our
most advanced instruments.  Thanks to the theoretical and
observational efforts of the XX century, today we know that millions
of black holes the size of our sun exist in our Galaxy, and in all
galaxies, and that the center of most galaxies&mdash;including our
own&mdash;harbor supermassive black holes millions to billion times
larger in mass.  Having revealed this astonishing picture is one of
the great successes of modern astrophysics, and the future promises to
be even more generous in insight and surprises.


<p>Dr. Dall'Osso graduated in Astronomy at the University of Bologna
(the oldest university in Europe founded over nine centuries ago, in
the year 1088), and got his PhD in Astronomy at the University of Rome,
specializing on the structure of ultramagnetic neutron stars
(magnetars) and the mystery of their origin.  From 2005 to 2010 he
worked at the Astronomical Observatory of Rome and at Pisa University,
further studying the physics of magnetars and their ability to emit
X/gamma-rays and gravitational waves.  He moved to the Hebrew
University of Jerusalem from 2010 to 2013, where he started working on
gamma-ray bursts, the most violent explosions in the universe, thought
to harbour the formation of black holes in the collapse of massive
stars.  From 2013 to 2015 he worked in Germany, at the University of
TÃ¼bingen, extending my studies on neutron stars and black holes as
sources of X-rays and gravitational waves.  In 2016 he moved to Stony
Brook, where he is extending his previous studies of gamma-ray bursts,
magnetars and gravitational wave sources in a novel and unified
framework.
