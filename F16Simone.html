    <h1>Black Holes from Early Speculations to Modern Astrophysics</h1>
    <h2>Dr. Simone Dall'Osso</h2>

  </CENTER>

  <p>Black holes are among the most enigmatic and fascinating
celestial bodies, that we can now
observe&mdash;indirectly&mdash;thanks to modern instruments able to
reveal them through high-energy radiation and gravitational wave
emission.

<p>The history of the concept of "dark star" can be dated back to the
physics of the XVIII century.  However, a proper definition of "black
holes" only became possible more than one century later, thanksto
Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, although Einstein himself
considered black holes as a mere mathematical oddity of his theory.

<p>Black holes do not allow any type of information to escape their
interior (the so-called "event horizon"), but their presence strongly
affects matter and space-time itself in their surroundings. It is this
"influence", with its very specific signatures, that our most advanced
instruments can now reveal and measure in great detail.

<p>Thanks to theoretical and observational efforts of the XX century,
we now know that millions of stellar-mass black holes exist in each
galaxy, and that the center of most galaxies&mdash;including our
own&mdash;harbor supermassive black holes with masses millions to
billion times larger than our sun. Having revealed this astonishing
picture is one of the great successes of modern astrophysics.

<p>In the last few years, the first detection of gravitational wave
signals from binary black holes, and the discovery of tidal
disruptions of stars by supermassive black holes, have opened up whole
new ways to "detect" black holes and to study their physics. Since
these are almost unexplored paths, the future promises to be even more
generous in discovery and surprises.

<p>Dr. Simone Dall’Osso graduated in Astronomy at the University of
Bologna, his hometown, and got a PhD in Astronomy at the University of
Rome, specializing on the structure of ultramagnetic neutron stars
(magnetars) and the mystery of their origin. Dr. Dall’Osso worked at
the Astronomical Observatory of Rome and at Pisa University,
broadening his interests on the physics of magnetars and their ability
to emit X/gamma-rays and gravitational waves. From there Dr. Dall’Osso
moved to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and started working on
Gamma-ray Bursts, the most violent explosions in the universe thought
to harbor the formation of black holes in the collapse of massive
stars. He also worked in Germany, at the University of Tübingen,
extending his work on neutron stars and black holes as sources of
X-rays and gravitational waves.  In 2016 Dr. Dall’Osso joined Stony
Brook, developing new approaches to study Gammaray Bursts, magnetars
and gravitational wave sources in a unified framework
